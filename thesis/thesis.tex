    We investigate a method, originally suggested in \cite{Webber:2009vm}, for determination of the masses of supersymmetric resonances and invisible final states in a certain type of cascade decays. We do our study within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with conservation of R-parity, but the method applies to any Beyond-Standard Model theory with a parity symmetry. The method formulates the mass determination as an optimization problem for which numerical techniques can be applied. The method was demonstrated in \cite{Webber:2009vm} by Monte Carlo simulations to have good prospects for accurate mass determination. We discover that there are certain problems with the method and the analysis, which lead to an under-estimation of the errors. In light of this, we present revised error estimates. We proceed to investigate alternative formulations of the method which might amend the issues, and present mass estimates and uncertainties for Monte Carlo analyses of these alternative formulations. We also investigate the effects of jet reconstruction, and show that this is an important source of error for the method.

\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction} 
Supersymmetry is a proposed extension of the Standard Model of particle physics which adds heavier partner particles, called superpartners, to the Standard Model particles. Supersymmetry is appealing because it can provide solutions to many of the unsolved problems of high-energy physics, problems which are either not adressed by the Standard Model or are inherent in the Standard Model itself. These problems include the Dark Matter which is observed to permeate the universe and the apparent fine-tuning needed to avoid large corrections to the Higgs boson mass.

This thesis begins with an introduction to the principles that underlie the Standard Model, and outlines the construction of the model in Chapter \ref{ch:SM_intro}. Then, the extension of the Standard Model by supersymmetry is introduced and elaborated, culminating in the definition of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), which is the minimal (in terms of field content) supersymmetric extension that contains the Standard Model. The MSSM has over 100 free parameters, so it is conventional to introduce some constraining assumptions. We present one popular restricted model, called the Constrained MSSM (CMSSM), and discuss its features and review its experimental status in light of LHC data. All of this takes place in Chapter \ref{ch:susyintro}.

In a scenario where supersymmetry (SUSY) exists with conservation of R-parity, there should be a neutral lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) which is absolutely stable. Additionally, all SUSY-particles will be produced in pairs in collisions. Any supersymmetric particle will decay down to the LSP, possibly in multiple steps. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, one typically expects squarks or gluinos, the supersymmetric partners of the quarks and gluons, which subsequently decay in a cascade down to the LSP, emitting multiple Standard Model particles in the process, see {\it e.g.}~\cite{Martin:1997ns}. The LSP escapes detection, but the energy and momentum of all the SM particles can be measured (assuming no neutrinos are produced).

Should hints of SUSY be seen at the LHC in the future, it will be important to determine the masses of the SUSY particles, and many methods have been investigated for this purpose, {\it e.g.}~see \cite{Barr:2010zj} for a review. In \cite{Webber:2009vm} a method for determining the masses by formulating the kinematics as a linear algebra problem is presented and discussed. The article specifically considers a pair of SUSY particles, each decaying to the LSP in a three-step cascade, emitting three Standard Model particles each. Determination of the masses then involve inverting an eight by eight matrix containing the measured Standard Model particle momenta, using it to determine the four-momenta, $p^\mu_\mathrm{inv},$ of the two invisible LSPs. Having calculated the invisible four-momenta, one can make a hypothesis for the eight unknown SUSY masses involved in the chains, and minimize $p^2_\mathrm{inv}-M^2_\mathrm{hyp}$ in order to obtain a best fit hypothesis (the minimized quantity should be zero for an on-shell particle). The article further demonstrates by a Monte Carlo simulation that a good fit can be obtained using only a few tens of events. This is a very desirable feature, since only a very limited number of SUSY candidate events are  expected at the LHC, given current limits on SUSY particle masses.

In Chapter \ref{ch:introducing_the_method} and \ref{ch:MC}, the method of \cite{Webber:2009vm} is presented and discussed. Chapter \ref{ch:introducing_the_method} formulates the type of process we are studying and the problems faced, and defines the method. We also discuss some minor issues with the original formulation and suggest ways to amend these. The subsequent chapters deal with an investigation of, and improvements on the method. We begin in Chapter \ref{ch:MC} by simulating events using the Monte Carlo generator {\tt Herwig++} and attempt to reproduce the results presented in \cite{Webber:2009vm}. In the course of this, we discover what appears to be problematic issues with the analysis in \cite{Webber:2009vm}, concerned with the numerical function minimization. We are able to reproduce our results using the same code as in the original article \cite{Webber:epost}, and this confirms the issues.

In light of this, we present revised estimates for the accuracy we can expect from the method. In Chapter \ref{ch:investigating_improvements}, we investigate ways to amend the problems by modifying the method in various ways. Although we are able to construct modified versions of the method which is free of the technical problems in the original formulation, we are unable to recover the accuracy promised by the original paper.

We finalize our analysis in Chapter \ref{ch:investigating_improvements} by taking the effects of jet reconstruction into account, something which was not considered in the original paper. We find that the uncertainties introduced by the jet reconstruction increases the errors significantly. Finally, we make our conclusions.

\chapter{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{ch:SM_intro}
The Standard Model of particle physics has been hugely successful in explaining what our universe consists of at the smallest length scales, and how these constituents interact with each other. It recieved a final, spectacular confirmation in 2012, when a Higgs boson consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model was discovered by the CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN \cite{Aad:2012tfa, Chatrchyan:2012ufa}. It is well known, however, that the Standard Model is incomplete as a description of our universe, for instance since it gives no explanation for Dark Matter. There are also more technical problems with the Standard Model, such as the hierarchy problem of the Higgs boson mass loop corrections and the arbitrariness of the model parameters.

The present chapter gives a brief introduction to the principles that underlie the Standard Model, and outlines the construction of the model. 
% The presentation is based on \cite{Mandl-Shaw} and \cite{Peskin-Schroeder}.

\section{Symmetries and conservation laws}
Symmetries are manifest in most physical systems. For instance, the special theory of relativity is symmetric under boosts and rotations, as well as translations in space and time. There is a deep relationship between symmetries and the conservation of physical quantities. This result is known as Noether's theorem, and was proven by Emmy Noether in 1915 \cite{Noether:1918zz}. It states that {\it every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law}. In the example of special relativity, the symmetries under translations in time and space correspond to conservation of energy and momentum.%, and the symmetry under rotation corresponds to conservation of angular momentum. \marginpar{What is the conserved quantity under boosts? Is it that ljyubliajsnski polarization vector? Check.}

\subsection{Description by groups}
It is often convenient to describe the symmetries of physical systems in the language of group theory. A group $G$ is a set of objects together with a binary operation $\cdot$ which satisfies the following properties:
\begin{align}
  &g_1\cdot g_2 \in G \quad \forall g_1, g_2 \in G &\text{(closure)},\\
  &\exists \, e \in G \quad \text{such that} \quad g\cdot e = e \cdot g = g \quad \forall \, g \in G &\text{(identity)},\\
  &\forall \, g \in G \quad \exists \, g^{-1} \in G \quad \text{such that} \quad g\cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1}\cdot g = e &\text{(inverse)},\\
  &(g_1\cdot g_2)\cdot g_3 = g_1\cdot(g_2\cdot g_3) \quad \forall \, g_1, g_2, g_3 \in G &\text{(associativity)}.
\end{align}
The set of all Lorentz boosts and rotations in special relativity form a group, called the Lorentz group, and together with all spatial translations they form the Poincar\'{e} group. 

The experimental fact that there exist a number of conserved quantities in particle physical systems --- examples include energy and momentum, but also electrical and colour charge, among others --- can be used to construct a theory of particle interactions, by finding the symmetries, and the symmetry groups, that correspond to these quantities and demanding that the theory be symmetric under their action.

An important type of group is the $SU(n)$ group. In the defining representation, this group consists of all complex unitary $n\times n$ matrices $M$ with $\mathrm{det}\,M=1$. The $SU(n)$ groups are {\it Lie groups}, which means that they are continuous --- {\it i.e.}\ that it is possible to find group elements that are arbitrarily close to the identity. Also, any transformation in the group may be constructed by successive application of such infinitesimal transformations. 

The group elements, and the objects on which the group acts, may be given in several {\it representations}. In the case of matrix groups this means matrices and vectors of different dimension. For an $SU(n)$ group, the two most important representations are the defining, or {\it fundamental}, representation, where the vectors have dimension $n$, and the {\it adjoint} representation, where the vectors have dimension $n^2-1$.

The infinitesimal behaviour of a Lie group is given by its corresponding {\it Lie algebra}, which is written\footnote{Here, and in the following, repeated indices are summed over, unless otherwise stated.} 
\begin{align}
	[T_a, T_b] = i f_{abc}T_c.
\end{align}
The objects $T_a$ are called the {\it generators} of the Lie group, and the $f_{abc}$ are called the {\it structure coefficients}. The structure coefficients uniquely determine the algebra. For $SU(n)$, there are $n^2 - 1$ generators, so $a,b,c =1,...,n^2-1$. For a general Lie group, the binary operation $[\cdot , \cdot ]$, called the {\it Lie bracket}, must be specified, but for $SU(n)$ is is just the commutator
\begin{align}
	[T_a, T_b] = T_aT_b - T_bT_a.
\end{align}

An element $G$ of an $SU(n)$ group may generally be written as
\begin{align}
	G = e^{i\alpha_a O_a},\label{eq:global_gauge_transformation}
\end{align}
in an open neighbourhood of the identity element in $SU(n)$. Here, $O_a = T_a$ in the fundamental representation, and $O_a = (f_{ij})_{a}$ in the adjoint representation. For $SU(2)$, the fundamental representation of the generators are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_i$, and for $SU(3)$ they are proportional to the Gell-Mann matrices $\lambda_i$. Formally, $G$ is the {\it exponential map} from a Lie algebra to its corresponding Lie group. 

The exponential map may be extended from a {\it global} transformation to a {\it local} transformation with respect to some underlying manifold $X$ by letting $\alpha_a = \alpha_a(x)$, where $x\in X$. For the purposes of the Standard Model, $X$ is space-time.




\section{Ingredients of the Standard Model}

The Standard Model consists of 12 fermions with corresponding antifermions, a number of vector gauge bosons and one scalar boson, whose existence have all been verified experimentally. The gauge bosons mediate interactions between the particles. There are three fundamental interactions in the Standard Model: The electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction and the strong interaction. The combination of electromagnetic and weak interactions are often referred to as the {\it electroweak} theory, or the {\it Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model}, while the theory describing the strong interaction is known as {\it Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)}. Not all particles couple to each other with all of the interactions. 

The fermions are divided into two groups, the quarks and leptons. There are six different {\it flavours} of quarks, called up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top, in order of increasing mass. They are subdivided into three generations of pairs, up/down, charm/strange and top/bottom. The up, charm and top quarks carry quanta of $+\frac{2}{3}$ of the fundamental electrical charge $e$, while the down, strange and bottom quarks carry $-\frac{1}{3}e$. There are also six leptons, of which three are charged. They are called the electron, the muon and the tau. They each belong in a generation of their own, together with their neutral counterparts, the electron neutrino, muon neutrino and tau neutrino, respectively. 

The vector gauge bosons consist of the photon, the $Z$ and $W$ bosons and the gluon. The photon is the mediator of electromagnetic interactions, the $Z$ and $W$ mediate the weak interaction and the gluon mediates the strong interaction. The photon, $Z$ boson and gluon are all neutral, and they are their own antiparticles. The photon and gluon are massless, while the $W$ and $Z$ bosons are quite heavy. The $W$ carries one elementary unit of electric charge, and is thus distinct from its antiparticle, with a difference in sign for the particle and antiparticle states. The scalar boson of the Standard Model is the Higgs boson, which is responsible for giving particles their observed mass through the Higgs mechanism. It is electrically neutral and very massive.

Among the fermions, only the quarks couple to the strong interaction. All the known fermions couple with the weak interaction, while only the electrically charged fermions couple electromagnetically --- {\it i.e.}\ all except the neutrinos. They couple to the Higgs field proportionally to their mass, so that for instance the top quark, which is the heaviest Standard Model particle, couples the strongest. A schematic overview of the particles in the Standard Model is shown in Fig.\  \ref{fig:SM_particles}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/susyintro/Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.pdf}
	\caption{An overview of the particles of the Standard Model and their interactions, from \cite{Wikimedia_SM_particles}.}
	\label{fig:SM_particles}
\end{figure}

The flavours of the quarks and leptons are conserved in the electromagnetic and strong interactions. For instance, a top quark cannot change into a charm or up quark by emission of a photon or gluon. The weak interaction enables the top quark to change into a bottom quark, or a tau lepton to change into a tau neutrino, through the emission of a charged $W$ boson. This would still seem to conserve the {\it generation} of quark or lepton, but breaking of generation is also made possible through the mechanism of {\it generation mixing}, quantified by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for the case of quarks and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix for the leptons. The PMNS mixing also explains the observed phenomenon of {\it neutrino oscillations}.\footnote{If the neutrinos are assumed to be massive, which they are technically not in the Standard Model.}

\section{Constructing a gauge theory}

The Standard Model is a quantum field theoretic model, and may be stated in terms of a Lagrangian density function $\mathcal{L}$. The guiding principle for constructing the Lagrangian is {\it gauge invariance}. Gauge degrees of freedom are physical degrees of freedom which are ``superflous'', in the sense that they do not have any observable consequences. An example is Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, where the electromagnetic vector potential $A^\mu$ is undetermined up to the addition of a total derivative term $\partial^\mu \phi$. The gauge freedom is exploited by requiring that the Lagrangian, which determines the physical dynamics, does not change when the gauge degrees of freedom are varied, {\it i.e.}\ that it is gauge invariant. This invariance is related to conservation of physical quantities by Noether's theorem.

The Standard Model is based on gauge invariance under three Lie groups, the famous $U(1)_Y\times SU(2)_L\times SU(3)_C$. The different particle types transform in different representations of the groups. In the Standard Model, the fermions transform in the fundamental representation, while the gauge bosons transform in the adjoint representation.

The particle content of the Standard Model is input into the Lagrangian by inserting fermionic fields, {\it i.e.}\ Dirac spinor fields, and imposing the desired gauge invariance on these fields. The basic Dirac term, called the Dirac bilinear, for some spinor field $\psi$, is\footnote{We will, for what follows, set $\hbar = c = 1$.} 
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_D = \bar \psi (i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \psi = \bar \psi (i\slashed\partial - m)\psi, \label{eq:diracbilinear}
\end{align}
where $\gamma_\mu$ are the Dirac matrices, $m$ is the mass of the spinor field, and $\bar\psi \equiv \psi^\dag \gamma_0$. The Dirac bilinear results in the Dirac equation for the field when the equations of motion are applied. The Dirac equation and the Dirac matrices are derived in Appendix \ref{appendix:diraceq}.

Next, we impose gauge invariance. The local group transformation of an $SU(n)$ group may be written in the fundamental representation as
\begin{align}
	G(x) = e^{ig\alpha_a(x)T_a},\label{eq:gauge_transformation}
\end{align}
where $\alpha_a(x)$ are $n$ arbitrary real differentiable functions, $g$ is the charge of the field, and $T_a$ are the generators of $SU(n)$ in the fundamental representation. We assume that the Lagrangian consists of $n$ Dirac bilinear terms with fields $\psi_i$, and that they are put into an $n$-dimensional multiplet $\Psi = (\psi_1, \psi_2, ..., \psi_n)^T$ such that the basic Dirac Lagrangian reads
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_0 = \bar\Psi(i\slashed\partial - m)\Psi,
\end{align}
where we assume that all fields have the same mass $m$.\footnote{This assumption is often wrong in the case of the Standard Model, but finds its solution in the Higgs mechanism.} The group transformations of the multiplet and its adjoint are then 
\begin{align}
	\Psi(x) &\overset{G}{\to} G(x) \Psi(x),\\
	\bar\Psi(x) &\overset{G}{\to} \bar\Psi(x) G^\dag(x).\nonumber
\end{align}
If we apply these transformations to the basic Lagrangian, it becomes
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_0 = &\bar\Psi(x)(i\slashed\partial - m)\Psi(x)\nonumber\\
	\overset{G}{\to} &\bar\Psi(x) G^\dag(x)(i\slashed\partial - m)G(x)\Psi(x)\\
	=	&\bar\Psi(x)(i\slashed\partial - m)\Psi(x) + i\bar\Psi(x) G^\dag(x) (\slashed \partial G(x)) \Psi(x).\nonumber
\end{align}
Thus, the basic Dirac Lagrangian is not gauge invariant, since we have picked up an additional term. Gauge invariance may be achieved by adding a term of the form 
\begin{align}
	g\bar\Psi(x) \gamma^\mu A_{a,\mu}(x) T_a \Psi(x),\label{eq:covariantderivativeterm}
\end{align}
to the Lagrangian, where $A_{a,\mu}(x)$ is some new field, which we require to transform under $G$ as
\begin{align}
	A_{a,\mu}(x)T_a \overset{G}{\to} G(x) \left( A_{a,\mu}(x) T_a + \frac{1}{g}\partial_\mu \right) G^\dag(x).\label{eq:gauge_boson_transformation}
\end{align}
If we apply $G$ to the sum of the Dirac bilinear with this new term, it is invariant:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_0 = &\bar\Psi(x)(i\slashed\partial - m)\Psi(x) + g\bar\Psi(x) \gamma^\mu A_{a,\mu}(x) T_a \Psi(x)\nonumber\\
	\overset{G}{\to} &\bar\Psi(x)(i\slashed\partial - m)\Psi(x) + i\bar\Psi(x) G^\dag(x) (\slashed \partial G(x)) \Psi(x)\\
	 &+ g\bar\Psi(x) \gamma^\mu A_{a,\mu}(x) T_a \Psi(x) -  i\bar\Psi(x) G^\dag(x) (\slashed \partial G(x)) \nonumber\\
	 = &\bar\Psi(x)(i\slashed\partial - m)\Psi(x) + g\bar\Psi(x) \gamma^\mu A_{a,\mu}(x) T_a \Psi(x).\nonumber
\end{align}
The term from Eq.\ \eqref{eq:covariantderivativeterm} is usually included by replacing $\partial_\mu$ with the {\it covariant derivative}
\begin{align}
	D_\mu = \partial_\mu - ig A_{a,\mu}T_a.
\end{align}
The fields $A_{a,\mu}$ are called gauge boson fields, and are responsible for mediating interactions between the Dirac fermion fields. The gauge boson fields must also have their own free-field term in the Lagrangian, called the {\it field strength}, which is given from the Proca Lagrangian for spin-1 fields as 
\begin{align}
	-\frac{1}{4} F_{a,\mu\nu} F_a^{\mu\nu},\label{eq:field_strength}
\end{align}
where $F_a^{\mu\nu}$ is given as
\begin{align}
	F_a^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu_a - \partial^\nu A^\mu_a + g f_{abc}A^\mu_b A^\nu_b,
\end{align}
where, again, $f_{abc}$ are the structure coefficients of $SU(n)$. Note that with this definition, the field strength \eqref{eq:field_strength} is gauge invariant under Eq.\ \ref{eq:gauge_boson_transformation}.

With this, the total gauge invariant Lagrangian consists of $n$ fermion fields and $n^2-1$ gauge boson fields, and reads
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L} = \bar\Psi(i\slashed D - m)\Psi - \frac{1}{4} F_{a,\mu\nu} F_a^{\mu\nu}.
\end{align}
The covariant derivative gives rise to terms coupling the fermion and gauge fields. In the case of $n=1$, the gauge group is the $U(1)$ group, which describes the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the simplest gauge theory. For $U(1)$, the structure coefficients vanish, since there is only a single gauge field,\footnote{This contradicts the claim that there are $n^2-1$ gauge fields --- for $U(n)$ there are $n^2$. The reason is that $U(1)$ is not an $SU(n)$ group, but the above derivation works for $U(1)$ as well.} making the Lagrangian particularily simple. In QED, there are no gauge boson self-interactions. For $n>1$, the structure coefficients do not vanish, and this gives rise to cross terms in the field strength term $-\frac{1}{4} F_{a,\mu\nu} F_a^{\mu\nu}$ coupling the gauge bosons among themselves. These couplings are of great importance in the theories of weak and strong interactions.




\section{Singlets, doublets and triplets}

As mentioned previously, not all the fermion fields are subject to all the different interactions. If a field couples through a certain interaction, it is said to be {\it charged} under the transformations corresponding to that interaction. A specific amount $g$ of charge is assigned to every field, and enters into the group transformations in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:gauge_transformation}. Thus, for $g=0$, the transformation is the identity and has no effect. In the electromagnetic $U(1)$ case, this charge is the electrical charge, $g=q$. Analogous charges are associated with the $U(1)_Y$, $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(3)_C$ groups. They are called hypercharge, weak isospin and colour charge, respectively. These charges are the conserved quantitites associated with the gauge symmetries, as implied by Noether's theorem. Since the terms in the Lagrangian coupling fermions to gauge bosons are proportional to the charges, they are often called {\it coupling constants} --- but the term coupling constant may also be used in a broader sense to mean the constant of proportionality in any Lagrangian term which gives rise to a coupling vertex.

In the case of $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$, the fields have to be put into vectors in order to be acted upon by the transformations, as was done in the previous section. Since the fermionic fields transform in the fundamental representation, the dimensions of the vectors are two and three, respectively. These types of vectors are referred to as $SU(2)$ {\it doublets} and $SU(3)$ {\it triplets}.

A Dirac field can be written as the sum of a left-chiral and a right-chiral part, defined by the projection operators 
\begin{align}
	P_{R/L} = \frac{1}{2}\left( 1\pm \gamma^5 \right),
\end{align}
where $\gamma^5 \equiv i\gamma^0\gamma^1\gamma^2\gamma^3$. Given a Dirac field $\psi$, we may write
\begin{align}
	\psi = P_R \psi + P_L \psi \equiv \psi_R + \psi_L.
\end{align}
In the case of $SU(2)_L$, only the left chiral part of the fields are charged under the symmetry. For instance, the left-chiral parts of the quark fields are put in doublets, {\it e.g.}\
\begin{align}
	q_L = \begin{pmatrix}
		u_L \\ d_L
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
for the up- and down-quarks, while the right-handed parts are put in two separate singlets $u_R$ and $d_R$, upon which the $SU(2)_L$ transformation has no effect. This has the consequence that the $SU(2)_L$ interaction is left-chiral --- it only couples to left-handed parts of fields. Due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $U(1)_Y\times SU(2)_L$ symmetry, the chirality is not exact in the resulting weak interactions, but it is still an important feature of the Standard Model.

The $SU(3)_C$ symmetry is the symmetry of the strong force, and among the fermions, only the quarks are charged under it. The quarks transform under $SU(3)$ in triplets --- one for each quark flavour --- where the components of the triplet are discriminated by differing {\it colour}, denoted red, green or blue. 


While the fermions transform under the groups in the fundamental representation, which has dimension $n$ for $SU(n)$, the gauge vector boson fields transform in the adjoint representation, which has dimension $n^2-1$. This number then determines the number of different gauge bosons for each group: $U(1)_Y$ has a single gauge boson field labeled $B^\mu$, $SU(2)_L$ has three, labeled $W^\mu_{1,2,3}$, and $SU(3)_C$ has eight different gauge boson fields, labeled $A^\mu_a$ for $a = 1,...,8$. The $SU(3)_C$ bosons are called {\it gluons}. The $U(1)_Y$ and $SU(2)_L$ bosons are not the ones that we observe --- the physical gauge boson eigenstates are linear combinations of them, mixed together by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs mechanism.

\section{The Higgs mechanism}
Gauge invariance forbids the inclusion of terms of the form $m^2A^\mu A_\mu$ into the Lagrangian, which are required in order to give vector bosons such as the $Z$ their observed mass. To include the terms, we must also include a new complex scalar field doublet $\Phi = (\phi_a, \phi_b)^T$. This mechanism was first suggested by Anderson \cite{1963PhRv..130..439A}, and subsequently generalized to a relativistic field theory independently by three groups: Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble \cite{1964PhRvL..13..585G}, Brout and Englert \cite{1964PhRvL..13..321E}, and Higgs \cite{Higgs:1964pj}. It is commonly referred to as the Higgs mechanism. The mechanism introduces the following terms into the Lagrangian:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal L \ni |D_\mu \Phi(x)|^2 - \mu^2|\Phi(x)|^2 - \lambda |\Phi(x)|^4.\label{eq:higgs_lagrange}
\end{align}
The last two terms comprise the Higgs {\it potential}. If $\mu^2$ is assumed to be negative and $\lambda$ positive, then the potential assumes the shape of a ``mexican hat'' as a function of $|\Phi|$. Figure  \ref{fig:higgspot} shows an analogous potential in the case of only a single complex scalar field $\phi$.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/susyintro/higgspot_nature.jpg}
	\caption{The shape of the Higgs potential, from \cite{Ellis:higgs}.}
	\label{fig:higgspot}
\end{figure}
This potential has a minimum and a circle of degenerate energy at the field value $|\Phi_0|^2 = |\phi_a^0|^2 + |\phi_b^0|^2 = -\mu^2/2\lambda$. The mechanism of {\it spontaneous symmetry breaking} occurs when, as the energy decreases, the Higgs field falls to the bottom of the degenerate circle and is forced to {\it choose} a particular point on the circle for its lowest energy state, the vacuum. This causes $\Phi$ to obtain a non-zero {\it vacuum expectation value} (vev). Without loss of generality, we may write $\Phi_0$ as
\begin{align}
	\Phi_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
		0 \\ v
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
in the vacuum state, where $v \equiv \sqrt{-\mu^2/\lambda}$. We may write $\Phi$ generally as
\begin{align}
	\Phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
		\eta_1(x) + i\eta_2(x) \\
		v + H(x) + i\eta_3(x)
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
One can find parameters $\xi_j$, $j=1,...,4$, such that, for a gauge transformation $G \in U(1)_Y\times SU(2)_L$, if
\begin{align}
	G^{-1} = e^{\frac{i}{v}\left(\xi_j\frac{1}{2}\sigma_j\right)} e^{\frac{i}{v} \xi_4},
\end{align}
then
\begin{align}
	\Phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} G^{-1} \begin{pmatrix}
		0 \\ v + H
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
Then, by gauge transforming the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ using $G$, one obtains
\begin{align}
	\Phi \overset{G}{\to} \Phi' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
		0 \\ v + H
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
and simultaneously, the vector gauge fields transform as
\begin{align}
	W^\mu_i &\overset{G}{\to} W'^\mu_i ,\label{eq:SSB_gauge_transformation}\\
	B^\mu &\overset{G}{\to} B'^\mu .\nonumber
\end{align}
In this gauge, the three degrees of freedom represented by the real scalar fields $\eta_i(x)$ are not present. The interpretation is that they are absorbed into the three bosons $W^\pm$ and $Z$, providing the longitudinal polarization degrees of freedom required for massive vector bosons. The remaining real scalar field $H(x)$ is the Higgs field.

This gauge choice also makes apparent that the gauge fields $W^\mu_i$ and $B^\mu$ mix together into the physical mass eigenstates $W^{\pm\mu}$ and $Z^\mu$. This can be seen from the covariant derivative term in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:higgs_lagrange}. In this gauge, the covariant derivative of $\Phi$ is
\begin{align}
	D'^\mu \Phi' = \left[ \partial^\mu + i g \frac{\sigma_j}{2} W_j'^\mu + i \frac{1}{2} g' B'^\mu \right]\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
		0 \\ v + H
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
where $g$ and $g'$ are the coupling constants of $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$, respectively, and $\sigma_j$ are the Pauli matrices. By multiplying out, this becomes
\begin{align}
	D'^\mu \Phi' = \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{ig}{2}(W'^\mu_1 - iW'^\mu_2) \frac{v+H(x)}{\sqrt{2}} \\
		\left( \partial^\mu - \frac{ig}{2}W'^\mu_3 + \frac{ig'}{2} B'^\mu \right) \frac{v+H(x)}{\sqrt{2}}\nonumber \label{eq:higgs_covariant_derivative_gauge_eigenstates}
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
By making the following definitions,
\begin{align}
	\tan\theta_W &= \frac{g'}{g},\\
	{W'}^\mu_3 &= \cos\theta_W Z^\mu + \sin\theta_W A^\mu,\\
	{B'}^\mu &= -\sin\theta_W Z^\mu + \cos\theta_W A^\mu,\\
	W^{\pm \mu} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left({W'}_1^\mu \mp i{W'}_2^\mu \right),
\end{align}
where $\theta_W$ is called the {\it weak mixing angle}, Eq.\ \eqref{eq:higgs_covariant_derivative_gauge_eigenstates} becomes 
\begin{align}
	D'^\mu\Phi' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{ig}{\sqrt{2}} W^{+\mu}\left(v+H\right) \\
		\partial^\mu H(x) - \frac{ig}{2\cos\theta_W}Z^\mu \left(v+H\right) 
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
Thus, the covariant derivative term $|D^\mu \Phi|^2$ is
\begin{align}
	|D^\mu \Phi|^2 = \frac{1}{2}&\left( \frac{g^2v^2}{2} W^{+\mu} W^-_\mu + g^2vHW^{+\mu}W^-_\mu \right.\nonumber\\
	&+ \frac{g^2}{2} W^{+\mu}W^-_\mu H^2 + \partial^\mu H \partial_\mu H + \frac{g^2v^2}{4\cos^2\theta_W} Z^\mu Z_\mu \\
	&+ \left. \frac{g^2}{2\cos^2\theta_W} v Z^\mu Z_\mu H + \frac{g^2}{4\cos^2\theta_W}Z^\mu Z_\mu H^2 \right).\nonumber
\end{align}
This expression contains the terms $\frac{g^2v^2}{8\cos^2\theta_W} Z^\mu Z_\mu$ and $\frac{g^2v^2}{4} W^{+\mu} W^-_\mu$, which are mass terms for the $Z$ and $W^\pm$ bosons, respectively, fixing their masses to
\begin{align}
	m_Z = \frac{1}{2\cos\theta_W}vg, \quad m_W = \frac{1}{2}vg.
\end{align}
Note that this means that at the Lagrangian level
\begin{align}
	m_Z = \frac{m_W}{\cos\theta_W}.
\end{align}
Note also that there is no mass term for the photon field $A^\mu$ --- it remains massless after symmetry breaking. This allows for the remaining $U(1)_\mathrm{em}$ symmetry, where $A^\mu$ is the corresponding gauge boson and the gauge charge is the electrical charge, which by Noether's theorem must be conserved in all processes of the Standard Model.

The Higgs mechanism also provides for the possibility of fermionic terms of the form 
\begin{align}
 	\bar\psi_i \psi_j y_{ij}(v+H) = y_{ij} \bar \psi_i  \psi_j H + v y_{ij} \bar\psi_i \psi_j.
 \end{align} 
 The terms of the first type couple the fermions to the Higgs field. For $i=j$, the terms of the second type are mass terms of the form written in the Dirac bilinear, Eq.\ \eqref{eq:diracbilinear}, and for $i\neq j$ they give rise to off-diagonal terms in the CKM and PMNS matrices. The coupling constants of these terms are called {\it Yukawa couplings}.

\section{The Feynman calculus and loop corrections}
\label{subsec:feynmancalculus}
Very few problems in the framework of the Standard Model can be solved exactly. Instead, calculations are done using perturbation theory to series expand the solution as an infinite sum of increasingly complicated, but decreasingly important, contributions in terms of powers of some small parameter. Feynman invented a technique for visualizing these expansions using diagrams, known as Feynman diagrams \cite{2005AmericanScientist}. For instance, the problem of electron-positron scattering has as one of its leading contributions the diagram shown in Fig.\  \ref{fig:feynmandiagram_a}. The next-to-leading order in the fine-structure constant $\alpha = e^2/4\pi$ includes the diagrams in figs. \ref{fig:feynmandiagram} (b), (c) and (d).

	\caption{Feynman diagrams of contributions to $e^+ e^-$ scattering. Made using {\tt JaxoDraw} \cite{Binosi:2003yf}.}
	\label{fig:feynmandiagram}
\end{figure}
The Feynman calculus associates each diagram with a specific mathematical expression called the Feynman amplitude $\mathcal{M}$ for that diagram. When several diagrams are included, the total amplitude for the process to the given order is the sum of the amplitudes from each diagram. The physical quantities of interest, {\it e.g.}\ cross sections and decay widths, are obtained by integrating the amplitude, or rather its absolute square, over all spin and momentum configurations of the system.

\section{Renormalization}
\label{sec:renormalization}
The subleading diagrams in a perturbative expansion, such as those shown in Fig.\  \ref{fig:feynmandiagram} (b--d), contain closed loops. These loops introduce extra momentum integrals into the calculations. Often, the integrals are divergent --- which is unacceptable from a physical viewpoint. The divergences can be understood and dealt with by using the techniques of {\it regularization} and {\it renormalization}. 
\subsection{Regularization}
Regularization is a means for parametrizing the divergence in terms of some small parameter $\epsilon$ which is zero in the physical limit. The most modern way to regularize a momentum integral is by using {\it dimensional regularization}: The original loop integral is an integral over four space-time dimensions. Dimensional regularization makes the substitution $4 \to d = 4-\epsilon$, so the integral becomes
\begin{align}
	\int d^4 \, k \to \int d^d \, k.
\end{align}
This integral is mathematically well-defined, and allows the divergences to be parametrized in terms of $\epsilon$.

An alternative to the dimensional regularization technique is to use a {\it momentum cutoff} $\Lambda$, which is infinite in the physical limit. One may even argue that new physics should come into play at higher energy scales, and therefore set the cutoff to a finite value, since the theory is valid only up to this energy. This will be applied to the calculation of Higgs mass loop corrections in Section \ref{sec:motivations_for_extending_the_SM}.

\subsection{Renormalization}
When the divergence has been isolated and parametrized, it needs to be explained physically. This is done by the process of renormalizing the theory. For instance, in the case of the photon propagator in quantum electrodynamics, illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:feynmandiagram_b}, the dimensionally regularized expression for the leading-order loop correction to the propagator is proportional to
\begin{align}
	\int_0^1 dx \, x (1-x) \left( \frac{2}{\epsilon} - \log \left(m^2 - x(1-x)q^2 \right) + \mathrm{constant~terms} \right), \label{eq:divergent_loop_result}
\end{align}
which blows up as $\epsilon\to 0$. Here, $q$ is the momentum of the propagating photon and $m$ is the mass of the fermions in the loop. Renormalization is the claim that this infinity is a part of the {\it bare} physical constants which are present in the Lagrangian, in this case the electrical charge, whose bare value is denoted $e_0$. These bare parameters are not observable quantities, only parameters in the Lagrangian. What is observed is the {\it renormalized} charge $e = e_0 + \delta e$, where $\delta e$ is the infinite shift that cancels Eq.\ \eqref{eq:divergent_loop_result}.

All the coupling constants of the Standard Model are renormalized. The renormalization introduces an {\it energy dependence} into the coupling constants, since the shift comes from loop corrections which depend on the energy of the process. For instance, the effective value of the electron charge in quantum electrodynamics, at some momentum $q$, is at one-loop order given as
\begin{align}
	e^2(q) = \frac{e_r^2}{1 - (e_r^2/6\pi^2)\log(q/M)},\label{eq:electron_charge_running}
\end{align}
where $e_r$ is some reference value for the charge, defined at the energy scale $q_r = M$. The fact that the coupling constants are not constant is referred to as the {\it running of the coupling constants}.

\subsection{The Callan-Symanzik equation}
The Callan-Symanzik, or {\it renormalization group} (RG), equation, is the equation which describes the running of the coupling constants in a systematic way for any interaction in a quantum field theory. It is obtained by requiring that the Greens function for the interaction, $G$, {\it i.e.}\ the propagator or coupling vertex, varies with the renormalization scale $M$ in such a way that the bare parameters of the Lagrangian are unchanged. For the example of massless QED, the Callan-Symanzik equation for a Greens function $G^{(n,m)}$ with $n$ electron fields and $m$ photon fields is \cite{Peskin-Schroeder}
\begin{align}
	\left[ M \frac{\partial}{\partial M} + \beta(e) \frac{\partial}{\partial e} + n\gamma_2(e) + m\gamma_3(e)\right] G^{(n,m)}(x_1, ..., x_n; M,e) = 0.\label{eq:callansymanzik}
\end{align}
The functions beta and gamma are defined as
\begin{align}
	\beta \equiv M\frac{\partial e}{\partial M} , \quad \gamma_i \equiv - M\frac{\partial \eta_i}{\partial M},
\end{align}
where $\delta\eta_i$ are the field-strength renormalization terms, shifting the field values of the electron and photon fields,
\begin{align}
	\psi \to (1 + \delta \eta_2) \psi \quad \mathrm{and} \quad A_\mu \to (1 + \delta\eta_3) A_\mu,
\end{align}
respectively. The Callan-Symanzik equation states that the combined effect of all the shifts in parameters induced by the renormalization should exactly weigh up for the shift in the Green's function itself, which is given by
\begin{align}
	G^{(n,m)} \to (1 + n\delta\eta_2 + m\delta\eta_3)G^{(n,m)}.
\end{align}
This is what is stated in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:callansymanzik}. The Callan-Symanzik equation for other interactions, such as the $SU(3)$ quantum chromodynamics, may be derived similarily, but its complexity grows with the complexity of the interaction.

The primary quantities of interest from a phenomenological viewpoint are the beta functions. They describe the change in the coupling constant and other parameters as a function of renormalization scale, and in the case of QED they may be used to derive the formula \eqref{eq:electron_charge_running} for the running of the electromagnetic coupling constant $e$. Equation \eqref{eq:electron_charge_running} shows that the electromagnetic coupling constant increases as a function of the energy $q$. The same turns out to be true for the weak coupling constant, while the strong coupling constant of QCD decreases with increasing energy. This last fact is called {\it asymptotic freedom}, and means that the quarks and gluons are unbound by strong forces in the limit of high energy, or equivalently, short distances. 





\section[Motivations for extending the Standard Model]{Motivations for extending the\\ Standard Model}
\label{sec:motivations_for_extending_the_SM}
The Standard Model provides a very accurate description of the matter we have around us, as well as three of the fundamental forces that are responsible for matter interactions. As a ``theory of everything'', it comes short since it does not describe the fourth fundamental force, gravity. Attempts at unifying the Standard Model with gravity have so far been unsuccessful. There are, however, also other motivations besides gravity for extending the Standard Model.

Since the Standard Model is widely believed to be a low-energy effective model of some more fundamental high-energy theory, it is speculated that the three interactions of the Standard Model unite at a higher energy and act as a single interaction under some larger gauge group, called a Grand Unified Theory (GUT). However, when the three couplings are evolved to high energies using the Callan-Symanzik equations, they do not meet at a single point. This is seen by many as a flaw of the Standard Model. In the theory of supersymmetry, the evolution of the couplings is altered, and they may meet at a single point. This effect is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:coupling_unification}. Supersymmetry is discussed in more detail in the next chapter.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/susyintro/unification.eps}
	\caption{Evolution of the inverse coupling constants $\alpha^{-1}_i = 4\pi/g^2_i$, for the cases of the Standard Model (dashed lines) and models with supersymmetry (solid lines). From \cite{Martin:1997ns}.}
	\label{fig:coupling_unification}
\end{figure}

Another issue with the Standard Model is that is has no candidate for particle Dark Matter. Observations over the last century have given strong evidence for the existence of some as yet unkown form of matter which is distributed in large quantites all over the universe --- in fact four times as much as our ordinary matter. It is widely believed that this Dark Matter is some form of particle. Dark matter interacts primarily, or possibly even solely, via gravitation, so the particle has to be colourless and electrically neutral, because the strength of these interactions would otherwise have lead to the particle having been observed by now. It also has to be long-lived in order to explain the abundance of Dark Matter that we observe in the universe today. These restrictions rule out most of the Standard Model particles, with the exception of neutrinos. But neutrinos are known to be very light, almost massless, and calculations of early-universe dynamics show that they are too light to be candidates for Dark Matter. 

There is also a more technical problem with the Standard Model, related to the scalar Higgs field. As discussed in Section \ref{subsec:feynmancalculus}, the calculations of parameters in a quantum field theory are subject to loop corrections. The Higgs mass parameter recieves corrections from loops containing all massive fermions, with the largest contribution coming from the top quark. The leading-order fermion contribution is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:higgs_correction_a} and is divergent.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/susyintro/higgs_top_loop.eps}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Loop corrections to the Higgs mass. {\bf (a)} shows the leading Standard Model contributions, and {\bf (b)} shows the corresponding supersymmetric contributions which cancel them.}
	\label{fig:higgs_correction}
\end{figure}
When it is evaluated using a cutoff regulator $\Lambda$, the diagram turns out to be quadratic in the regulator. This is shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:higgs_mass_loop_correction}. By arguing that the Standard Model only is valid up to the energy scale of grand unification, one may set $\Lambda = M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \sim 10^{16}~\mathrm{GeV}$. This means that the Higgs mass corrections are many orders of magnitude larger than the observed Higgs mass of 126 GeV, implying the need very nearly exact cancellations among the correction terms with different signs.

The fermions and vector bosons of the Standard Model also recieve corrections, but because of chiral and gauge symmetries, these can be shown to be at most logarithmically divergent in terms of $\Lambda$. For the scalar Higgs particle, there is no such ``protective symmetry''. Neither are there any other symmetries in the Standard Model which says that a cancellation should occur, so it appears to be an ``accident'' of nature. Such accidents are seen as unnatural, and this explanation is thus unsatisfactory from a theoretical viewpoint. This is referred to as the {\it hierarchy problem} of the Higgs mass. 

In supersymmetry, new scalar degrees of freedom enter into the loop corrections as illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:higgs_correction_b} for scalar ``sfermions'' $\tilde f$. This diagram is also calculated in Appendix \ref{appendix:higgs_mass_loop_correction}. The leading-order loop correction contributions from fermions and sfermions combined are in unbroken supersymmetry
\begin{align}
	\Delta m_H^2 = -\frac{|\lambda_f|^2}{8\pi^2}\Lambda^2 + \frac{\lambda_{\tilde f}}{16\pi^2}\Lambda^2 + \cdots\label{eq:higgs_mass_corrections}
\end{align}
to leading order in $\Lambda$, where $\lambda_{f/\tilde f}$ are the coupling strengths to fermions/sfermions. In supersymmetry, the coupling for a fermion $f$ is related to its sfermion partner by $|\lambda_f|^2 = \lambda_{\tilde f}$, and there are exactly two sfermions for each fermion. Thus, in supersymmetry, the corrections cancel each other in a natural way.

\label{ch:susyintro}
The theory of supersymmetry (SUSY) is a proposed extension of the Standard Model which increases the number of degrees of freedom by introducing a symmetry between fermions and bosons, called a supersymmetry. The construction of supersymmetry is in some sense a two-step process, where one first derives the Lagrangian of a theory with complete symmetry between fermions and bosons, meaning that every bosonic degree of freedom gets a corresponding `supersymmetric' fermionic degree of freedom, and {\it vice versa}. These fields only differ in spin. But since, for example, scalar, colour charged particles with the same mass as the quarks are not observed in experiments, the symmetry cannot be exact. To make the theory physically viable, the supersymmetric partners must in most cases be significantly heavier than their Standard Model counterparts. This means that the supersymmetry must be a broken symmetry, and this breaking is in practice put into the theory by hand.

In this chapter we will outline the construction of a supersymmetric theory. First, we introduce the group theoretic framework of the symmetries. We define the concept of superfields, fields transforming under representations of the supersymmetry group. We go on to construct a fully supersymmetric Lagrangian in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Then the breaking of supersymmetry is achieved by manually inserting so-called ``soft'' supersymmetry-breaking terms. Also, the concept of R-parity is introduced in order to ensure the stability of the proton. R-parity will also make the lightest supersymmetric particle a good Dark Matter candidate. From the broken supersymmetry Lagrangian, we extract the particle content --- identifying the familiar fields of the Standard Model as well as their supersymmetric counterparts. We then introduce a popular phenomenological model used to constrain and study the parameter space of the MSSM, and discuss its implications for the hierarchy of supersymmetric masses. This constrained model is subsequently adopted for the study of particular supersymmetric cascade decays, which is the topic for the remainder of the thesis. We will also review the current experimental status of supersymmetry.

\section{Extending the Poincar\'{e} symmetry}
In the beginning of Chapter \ref{ch:SM_intro}, the Poincar\'{e} group was introduced. It is the group of all Lorentz boosts and rotations, as well as all translations in spacetime. It is defined by its Lie algebra, called the {\it Poincar\'{e} algebra},
\begin{align}
	[M_{\mu\nu}, M_{\rho\sigma}] &= -i(g_{\mu\rho}M_{\nu\sigma} - g_{\mu\sigma}M_{\nu\rho} - g_{\nu\rho}M_{\mu\sigma} + g_{\nu\sigma}M_{\mu\rho}),\\
	[P_\mu, P_\nu] &= 0,\\
	[M_{\mu\nu}, P_\rho] &= -i(g_{\mu\rho}P_\nu - g_{\nu\rho}P_\mu),
\end{align}
where $M_{\mu\nu}$ are the generators of Lorentz boosts and rotations and $P_\mu$ are the momentum operators, the generators of translations. Any physical theory obeying Special Relativity must be invariant under the Poincar\'{e} group. It was shown in 1967 by Coleman and Mandula \cite{PhysRev.159.1251}, during attempts to unify Special Relativity with the observed global hadron flavour symmetry groups in a larger symmetry group structure, that there exists no Lie-algebra based extension of the Poincar\'{e} symmetry which includes the gauge groups of the Standard Model in a non-trivial way, {\it i.e.}\ a way by which the extended group cannot be written as a direct product such that the groups do not couple to each other.

This prompted Haag, \L{}opusza\'{n}ski and Sohnius \cite{Haag1975257} to introduce the concept of a {\it superalgebra}. A superalgebra, or {\it graded} Lie algebra, $L$, is a direct sum of two Lie algebras $L_0$ and $L_1$, $L = L_0 \oplus L_1$, with a special binary operation called a {\it grading}. For $x_i \in L_i$, the grading operation is given by
\begin{align}
	x_i \cdot x_j = x_k \in L_{i+j~\mathrm{mod}\,2},
\end{align}
which means that $x_0 \cdot x_0 \in L_0$, $x_1 \cdot x_1 \in L_0$ and $x_0 \cdot x_1 \in L_1$. 

Haag {\it et.\ al.}\ constructed a superalgebra by combining the Poincar\'{e} algebra with an algebra spanned by four operators called {\it Majorana spinor charges}, represented by a two-component Weyl spinor $Q_A$ (to be defined shortly) and its hermitian conjugate $\bar Q_{\dot A}$. The resulting superalgebra is given by the (anti)commutation relations
\begin{align}
	[Q_A,P_\mu] &= [\bar Q_{\dot A}, P_\mu] = 0,\label{eq:susy_algebra_begin}\\
	[Q_A, M_{\mu\nu}] &= \sigma_{\mu\nu,A}^B Q_B,\\
	\{Q_A, Q_B\} &= \{\bar Q_{\dot A}, \bar Q_{\dot B} \} = 0,\\
	\{Q_A, \bar Q_{\dot B} \} &= 2\sigma^\mu_{A \dot B} P_\mu,\label{eq:susy_algebra_end}
\end{align}
where $\sigma_\mu = (1_{2\times2},\sigma_i)$, with $\sigma_i$ the Pauli matrices and $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{4}(\sigma_\mu \bar\sigma_\nu - \sigma_\nu \bar\sigma_\mu)$. It is possible to extend the superalgebra further by introducing more Majorana spinor charges, labeled $Q_A^\alpha$ for $\alpha=1,...,N$. For general $N$, this extension can be shown to be the largest possible extension of the Poincar\'{e} group. The extension defined by Eqs.\ \eqref{eq:susy_algebra_begin}--\eqref{eq:susy_algebra_end} is called $N=1$ supersymmetry. The transformations corresponding to the superalgebra are called {\it supersymmetry transformations}.

In the usual spinor representation of the Poincar\'{e} group, the fermion fields are represented as four-component Dirac spinors. It can be shown that the Poincar\'{e} group is isomorphic to $SL(2,\mathbb{C})\times SL(2,\mathbb{C})$, so it is possible to define the theory using the representations of this group instead. The $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ group has two inequivalent fundamental representations by two-component spinors which are called {\it left- and right-handed Weyl spinors} and written as $\psi_A$ and $\bar\psi_{\dot A}$, respectively. 


\section{Superfields}
The objects transforming under supersymmetry transformations can be represented by {\it superfields}, which are functions defined on the {\it superspace} spanned by the spacetime coordinates $x^\mu$ and four anti-commuting Grassman numbers $\theta_A$ and $\bar\theta_{\dot A}$.  There are two important types of superfields, called chiral and vector superfields. Because of the anticommutativity, which means that any Grassman number squared vanishes, a function of a Grassman number, $f(\theta_A)$, has an all-order expansion given by
\begin{align}
	f(\theta_A) = a + b\theta_A.
\end{align}
Using this fact, a superfield $\Phi$ may generally be written as
\begin{align}
	\Phi\left(x^\mu, \theta_A, \bar\theta_{\dot A}\right) = &f(x) + \theta^A\phi_A(x) + \bar\theta_{\dot A}\bar\chi^{\dot A}(x) + \theta \theta m(x)\\
	 &+ \bar\theta \bar\theta n(x) + \theta\sigma^\mu \bar\theta V_\mu(x) + \theta\theta\bar\theta_{\dot A}\bar\lambda^{\dot A}(x) + \bar\theta \bar\theta \theta^A \psi_A(x) + \theta \theta \bar\theta \bar\theta d(x).\nonumber
\end{align}
The different field components have the following properties: $f(x)$, $m(x)$ and $n(x)$ are complex (pseudo)scalars, $\psi_A(x)$ and $\phi_A(x)$ are left-handed Weyl spinors, $\bar\chi^{\dot A}(x)$ and $\bar\lambda^{\dot A}(x)$ are right-handed Weyl spinors, $V_\mu (x)$ is a complex Lorentz four-vector and $d(x)$ is a complex scalar.

% \end{itemize}

A supersymmetry transformation on a superfield $\Phi(x^\mu, \theta, \bar\theta)$ in terms of infinitesimal parameters $\xi_A$ and $\bar\xi^{\dot A}$ may be written \cite{Martin:1997ns}
\begin{align}
	\delta_\xi \Phi &= \left( \xi^A \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^A} + \bar\xi_{\dot A}\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar\theta_{\dot A}} + i\left[ \xi\sigma^\mu \bar\theta + \bar\xi \bar\sigma^\mu \theta  \right]\partial_\mu \right)\Phi\label{eq:susy_transformation}\\
	&= \Phi(x^\mu + i\xi\sigma^\mu\bar\theta + i\bar\xi \bar\sigma^\mu \theta, \theta + \xi, \bar\theta + \bar\xi) - \Phi(x^\mu, \theta, \bar\theta).\nonumber
\end{align}
A set of covariant derivatives are defined by
\begin{align}
	D_A = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^A} - i\sigma^\mu_{A \dot A}\bar\theta^{\dot A}\partial_\mu, \quad \bar D^{\dot A} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar \theta_{\dot A}} + i\bar\sigma^{\mu,A \dot A}\theta_A \partial_\mu,
\end{align}
which can be shown to satisfy
\begin{align}
 	\delta_\xi (D_A \Phi) = D_A ( \delta_\xi \Phi), \quad \delta_\xi (\bar D^{\dot A} \Phi ) = \bar D^{\dot A} ( \delta_\xi \Phi),
 \end{align}
 so that they are indeed supersymmetrically covariant. In terms of these, a {\it left chiral} superfield $\Phi$ is defined by the condition
\begin{align}
	\bar D^{\dot A} \Phi = 0.
\end{align}

By substituting $y^\mu = x^\mu - i\theta\sigma^\mu \bar \theta$, the covariant derivative $\bar D^{\dot A}$ is given as
\begin{align}
	\bar D^{\dot A} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar\theta_{\dot A}}.
\end{align}
This shows that a left-chiral superfield must be independent of $\bar \theta$ in these coordinates, so it may generally be written as
\begin{align}
	\Phi(y, \theta) = A(y) + \sqrt{2}\theta\psi(y) + \theta\theta F(y), 
\end{align}
thus containing two complex scalar fields and a left-handed Weyl spinor. Under the infinitesimal supersymmetry transformation defined in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:susy_transformation}, the component field $F$ can be shown to transform into a total derivative. It will thus not contribute to the action, since all fields must vanish on the boundary at infinity. For this reason it is called an auxillary field. Thus we see that a left-chiral superfield contains two bosonic (scalar) degrees of freedom and two fermionic degrees of freedom contained in a left-handed Weyl spinor. Similar arguments may be applied to define a right-chiral superfield by the condition
\begin{align}
	D_A \Phi^\dag = 0,
\end{align}
and to show that it contains two auxillary and two proper scalar degrees of freedom, as well as a right-handed Weyl spinor. 

A {\it vector superfield} $V$ is defined by the condition
\begin{align}
	V^\dag = V.
\end{align}
This condition allows the field content
\begin{align}
	V = &f(x) + \theta^A\phi_A(x) + \bar\theta_{\dot A}\bar\chi^{\dot A}(x) + \theta \theta m(x) + \bar\theta \bar\theta m^*(x)\\
	 &+ \theta\sigma^\mu \bar\theta V_\mu(x) + \theta\theta\bar\theta_{\dot A}\bar\lambda^{\dot A}(x) + \bar\theta \bar\theta \theta^A \lambda_A(x) + \theta \theta \bar\theta \bar\theta d(x).
\end{align}
Here, the scalar fields $f(x)$ and $d(x)$, as well as the four-vector $V_\mu (x)$, are required to be real fields, thus halving their amount of degrees of freedom. There are auxillary degrees of freedom which may be removed by a gauge transformation. One gauge which removes all auxillary fields from a vector superfield is the {\it Wess-Zumino} gauge. A vector superfield may in this gauge be written as
\begin{align}
	V_\mathrm{WZ} = (\theta \sigma^\mu \bar\theta) \left[ V_\mu(x) + i\partial_\mu (A(x) - A^*(x)) \right] + \theta\theta \bar\theta_{\dot A} \bar\lambda^{\dot A}(x) + \bar\theta \bar\theta \theta_A \lambda^A(x) + \theta\theta \bar\theta \bar\theta d(x),
\end{align}
where $A(x)$ is a complex scalar field obeying $A(x) + A^*(x) = 2\Re A(x) = -f(x)$. In this gauge, the vector superfield contains one real scalar field degree of freedom (d.o.f.) from $d(x)$, three gauge field d.o.f.'s from $\left[ V_\mu(x) + i\partial_\mu (A(x) - A^*(x)) \right]$ and four fermion d.o.f.'s from the Weyl spinors $\lambda(x)$ and $\bar\lambda(x)$.\footnote{$V_\mu(x)$ has four d.o.f.'s, but one d.o.f.\ is removed by the gauge freedom of the imaginary part of $A(x)$.}

\section{The unbroken supersymmetric Lagrangian}
\label{sec:unbroken_susy}
To obtain a theory which is supersymmetric, the action, given by
\begin{align}
 	S = \int d^4 x \mathcal{L},
 \end{align}
 needs to be invariant under supersymmetry transformations. As mentioned in the previous section, a total derivative has this property because its integral is determined by the boundary conditions, where it has to vanish. It can be shown that the highest-order component fields in $\theta$ and $\bar \theta$, {\it i.e.}\ the term proportional to $\theta\theta\bar\theta\bar\theta$, always has this property for both chiral and vector superfields and products thereof. Thus the invariance of the action may be ensured by redefining the Lagrangian using superfields such that
 \begin{align}
 	S = \int d^4 x \int d^4 \theta \mathcal{L},\label{eq:SUSY_lagrangian_projection_definition}
 \end{align}
 where the last integral is over the four Grassman variables. This will project out only the desired terms, because of how the Grassman integral is defined. Thus the supersymmetric Lagrangian may be constructed from superfields and their products. It can be written generically as
 \begin{align}
 	\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\theta\theta \bar\theta \bar\theta} + \theta \theta \mathcal{L}_{\bar\theta \bar\theta} + \bar\theta \bar\theta \mathcal{L}_{\theta \theta},\label{eq:SUSY_lagrangian_projection_terms}
 \end{align}
 where the indices indicate the highest power of $\theta$ in each term. Note that this alters the dimensions of $\mathcal{L}$, since the Grassman variables $\theta$ have mass dimension $-1/2$.

The {\it superpotential} $W$ is defined as a product of left-chiral superfields,
 \begin{align}
 	W(\Phi) = L^i\Phi_i + \frac{1}{2}m^{ij}\Phi_i\Phi_j + \frac{1}{3}\lambda^{ijk}\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k.
 \end{align}
The inclusion of higher-order field terms is ruled out by the condition of renormalizability, which forbids terms where the combined mass dimension of the factors (including the leading Grassman coordinates in Eq.\ \ref{eq:SUSY_lagrangian_projection_terms} and the differential $d^4\theta$ in Eq.\ \ref{eq:SUSY_lagrangian_projection_definition}) are larger than four. Scalar, fermionic and auxillary fields have mass dimension 1, 3/2 and 2, respectively, and the Grassman coordinates $\theta$ have dimension $-1/2$. The most general Lagrangian that can be written in terms of chiral superfields is
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L} = \Phi_i^\dag \Phi_i + \bar\theta\bar\theta W(\Phi) + \theta\theta W(\Phi^\dag),
\end{align}
where the first term is called the kinetic term. 

The Lagrangian has to be gauge invariant. The general gauge transformation of a chiral superfield under a group $G$ is defined by
\begin{align}
	\Phi \overset{G}{\to} e^{-iq\Lambda^a T_a}\Phi,
\end{align}
where $T_a$ are the group generators, $q$ is the charge of $\Phi$ under $G$ and the gauge parameters $\Lambda_a$ can be shown to be left-chiral superfields. The equivalent transformation for a right-chiral superfield $\Phi^\dag$ involves a right-chiral superfield gauge parameter $\Lambda_a^\dag$.

Analogously to the Standard Model, the supersymmetric gauge interactions are introduced as compensating terms to the gauge transformation of the chiral superfields. The analogue to the gauge boson fields are the vector superfields $V^a$, which are introduced into the kinetic terms of the Lagrangian by writing them as
\begin{align}
	\Phi^\dag_i e^{q_i V^a T_a}\Phi_i,
\end{align}
so that the kinetic term transforms as
\begin{align}
	\Phi_i^\dag e^{q_i V^a T_a}\Phi_i \overset{G}{\to} \Phi_i^\dag e^{iq_i(\Lambda^a)^\dag T_a}e^{q_iV^{'a}T_a}e^{-iq_i\Lambda^a T_a}\Phi_i,
\end{align}
which is invariant given that the vector superfields transform as
\begin{align}
	e^{qV^{'a} T_a} = e^{-iq(\Lambda^a)^\dag T_a}e^{qV^a T_a}e^{iq\Lambda^a T_a}.
\end{align}
For infinitesimal $\Lambda$, this is to leading order
\begin{align}
	V^{'a} = V^a + i(\Lambda^a - (\Lambda^a)^\dag) - \frac{1}{2}qf^a_{bc} V^b ((\Lambda^c)^\dag + \Lambda^c).
\end{align}
This gives for the vector component fields of the vector superfields, $V_\mu^a$,
\begin{align}
	V^a_\mu \overset{G}{\to} V^{'a}_\mu = V_\mu^a + i\partial_\mu(A^a - (A^a)^* - qf^{abc} V_\mu^b (A^c + (A^{c})^*).
\end{align}
With these definitions, it can be shown that the Standard Model couplings of fermions with bosons are recovered by defining the covariant derivative
\begin{align}
	D_\mu^i = \partial_\mu - \frac{i}{2} q_i V_\mu.
\end{align}

The terms of the supersymmetric Lagrangian containing the field strengths of the gauge fields are written as
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Tr}[W^A W_A],
\end{align}
where $W_A$ and $\bar W_{\dot A}$ are left- and right-handed chiral superfields, respectively, given by
\begin{align}
	W_A &\equiv -\frac{1}{4}\bar D\bar D e^{-qV^aT_a} D_A e^{qV^a T_a},\\
	\bar W_{\dot A} &\equiv -\frac{1}{4} D D e^{-qV^aT_a} \bar D_{\dot A} e^{qV^a T_a}.
\end{align}
The most general form of the supersymmetric Lagrangian is then
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L} = \Phi^\dag e^{qV^a T_a}\Phi + \bar\theta\bar\theta W(\Phi) + \theta\theta W(\Phi^\dag) + \frac{1}{2T(R)}\bar\theta\bar\theta \mathrm{Tr}(W^A W_A),
\end{align}
where $T(R)$, the {\it Dynkin index} of the representation of the gauge group, is a normalization constant.



\section{Supersymmetry breaking}
\label{sec:susybreaking}
Supersymmetry has to be a broken theory, at least in the low-energy limit, since supersymmetric particles with Standard Model masses are not observed. The breaking can be inserted into the supersymmetry Lagrangian by hand, by explicitly adding terms that break supersymmetry and allow for mass splitting. The rationale for these terms is that the SUSY Lagrangian is only an effective Lagrangian where some heavy fields have been integrated out, and that the breaking of SUSY occurs through these fields at a higher scale through a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism similar to the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model. 

There are several alternatives for the mechanisms of SUSY breaking, some of which are Planck-scale mediated SUSY breaking, gauge mediated SUSY breaking and anomaly mediated SUSY breaking. Whichever of the mechanisms is chosen, there are only a finite set of terms that may be added to the Lagrangian without reintroducing the hierarchy problems of the Higgs mass loop corrections. They are called {\it soft} SUSY breaking terms, and are required to have couplings of mass dimension one or higher. They may in the most general form be written
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{soft} = &-\frac{1}{4T(R)}M\theta\theta\bar\theta\bar\theta \mathrm{Tr} [W^A W_A] - \frac{1}{6}a_{ijk} \theta\theta\bar\theta\bar\theta\Phi_i \Phi_j \Phi_k\nonumber\\
	&-\frac{1}{2}b_{ij} \theta\theta\bar\theta\bar\theta\Phi_i \Phi_j - t_i \theta\theta\bar\theta\bar\theta \Phi_i + \mathrm{h.c.}\\
	&-m_{ij} \theta\theta\bar\theta\bar\theta \Phi_i^\dag \Phi_j.\nonumber
\end{align}
In terms of the component fields of the superfields, the soft Lagrangian may be written
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{soft} = &-\frac{1}{2} M\lambda^A\lambda_A - \left( \frac{1}{6} a_{ijk} A_i A_j A_k + \frac{1}{2} b_{ij} A_i A_j + t_i A_i + \frac{1}{2} c_{ijk} A^*_i A_j A_k + \mathrm{c.c.}\right)\\
	&- m_{ij}^2 A_i^* A_j.\nonumber
\end{align}
Since this contains both Weyl spinor fields $\lambda_A$ and scalar fields $A_i$, the soft terms may be used to modify masses and couplings of the superpartner scalar and fermionic fields which will appear below.



\section[The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]{The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\\ Model}
The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the minimal supersymmetric theory which contains the field content of the Standard Model. It is constructed by choosing superfields in accordance with the requirements deduced in the previous sections. To construct a Dirac fermion, we use one left-chiral and one right-chiral superfield together. This gives the four fermionic degrees of freedom that a Dirac fermion and its antiparticle require. Since each chiral superfield also contains two scalar degrees of freedom (after removing the auxillary fields), this introduces two scalar particle-antiparticle pairs, which are called the supersymmetric partners, or {\it superpartners}, of the Dirac fermion. An important point is that all superfield components must have the same charge under all gauge groups, due to the way the gauge transformation was defined. This also means that the scalar fields generally will be charged, and that the supersymmetric partner fields have the same couplings as their Standard Model counterparts.

The superfields for the charged leptons are denoted $l_i$ and $\bar E_i$ for the left- and right-chiral superfields, respectively, and the left-handed neutrino superfields are denoted $\nu_i$. Here, $i=1,2,3$ is a generation index. The $SU(2)_L$ doublet of the Standard Model is recovered by setting $L_i = (\nu_i, l_i)$. The quark superfields are denoted $u_i$, $\bar U_i$, $d_i$ and $\bar D_i$, where $Q_i = (u_i, d_i)$ makes the $SU(2)_L$ doublet.

The gauge boson fields come from the vector superfields, each of which also contains two Weyl-spinor fields of opposite handedness. To obey gauge invariance, $n^2-1$ vector superfields are required for each of the $SU(n)$ groups just as in the Standard Model, {\it i.e.}\ gauge invariance under $U(1)_Y\times SU(2)_L \times SU(3)_C$ requires 1+3+8 vector superfields.\footnote{Again, $n^2$ rather than $n^2-1$ for the $U(1)$ group.} These are denoted $B^0$, $W^a$ and $C^a$, respectively. The Weyl spinor fields, the superpartners of the gauge fields, are written as $\tilde B^0$, $\tilde W^a$ and $\tilde g$, respectively. In the literature, these are referred to as {\it bino}, {\it wino} and {\it gluino}. 

The MSSM requires two Higgs superfield $SU(2)_L$ doublets to be able to give mass to both up- and down-type quarks. In the Standard Model, the same Higgs doublet can be used for both types by rotating the components using the $SU(2)_L$ generators, but this is not possible in SUSY because it would mix left- and right-handed superfields in the superpotential. The Higgs doublets in the MSSM are
\begin{align}
	H_u = \begin{pmatrix}
		H_u^+ \\ H_u^0
	\end{pmatrix}, \quad H_d = \begin{pmatrix}
		H_d^0 \\ H_d^-
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
where the sign indicates electric charge. This introduces several additional Higgs scalars into the model, as well as their fermionic superpartner fields.

Using the fields listed above, the MSSM Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{MSSM}$ may be constructed, subject to the rules for a general gauge invariant SUSY Lagrangian that were derived in sections \ref{sec:unbroken_susy} and \ref{sec:susybreaking}. This gives rise to kinetic terms, superpotential terms, supersymmetric field strength terms and soft SUSY breaking terms. The total MSSM Lagrangian is
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{kin} + W + \mathcal{L}_V + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{soft}.
\end{align}
The kinetic terms are given by
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{kin} = &L_i^\dag e^{\frac{1}{2}g\sigma W - \frac{1}{2}g'B} L_i + Q_i^\dag e^{\frac{1}{2}g_s \lambda C + \frac{1}{2}g\sigma W + \frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}g'B}Q_i\nonumber \\
	&+ \bar U_i^\dag e^{\frac{1}{2}g_s \lambda C - \frac{4}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}g'B}\bar U_i + \bar D_i^\dag e^{\frac{1}{2}g_s \lambda C + \frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}g'B}\bar D_i \\
	&+ \bar E_i^\dag e^{2\frac{1}{2}g'B}\bar E_i + H_u^\dag e^{\frac{1}{2}g\sigma W + \frac{1}{2} g' B} H_u + H_d^\dag e^{\frac{1}{2}g\sigma W - \frac{1}{2}g'B} H_d,\nonumber
\end{align}
where $g'$, $g$ and $g_s$ are the coupling constants of $U(1)_Y$, $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(3)_C$, respectively. The hypercharge under $U(1)_Y$ is assigned in units of $\frac{1}{2}g'$ as a convention. Also, factors of $\frac{1}{2}$ are used in the transformations of $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(3)_C$ to avoid accumulation of numerical factors because of how the generators are defined. With these conventions, the electroweak relationship between electric charge $Q$, hypercharge $Y$ and weak isospin $T_3$ is
\begin{align}
	Q = \frac{Y}{2} + T_3.
\end{align}
The field strength terms are 
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_V = &\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Tr} \left[ W^A W_A \right] \bar\theta\bar\theta + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Tr} \left[ C^A C_A \right] \bar\theta\bar\theta + \frac{1}{4}B^A B_A \bar\theta\bar\theta + \mathrm{h.c.},
\end{align}
where the field strengths are given as
\begin{align}
	W_A &= -\frac{1}{4}\bar D \bar D e^{-W} D_A e^W, \quad 	W = \frac{1}{2}g\sigma^a W^a,\\
	C_A &= -\frac{1}{4}\bar D \bar D e^{-C} D_A e^C,  \quad	C = \frac{1}{2}g_s \lambda^a C^a,\\
	B_A &= -\frac{1}{4}\bar D \bar D D_A B,  \quad			B = \frac{1}{2}g' B^0.
\end{align}
The possible gauge invariant terms of the MSSM superpotential $W$ are
\begin{align}
	W = &\mu H_u H_d + \mu'_i L_i H_u + y_{ij}^e L_i H_d E_j y_{ij}^u Q_i H_u \bar U_j + y_{ij}^d Q_i H_d \bar D_j \label{eq:mssm_superpotential} \\
		&+\lambda_{ijk}L_i L_j \bar E_k + \lambda'_{ijk} L_i Q_j \bar D_k + \lambda''_{ijk} \bar U_i \bar D_j \bar D_k,\nonumber
\end{align} 
where $H_u H_d$ is shorthand for $H_u^T i \sigma_2 H_d$, to make the term $SU(2)_L$ invariant. 

\subsection{R-parity}
The superpotential in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:mssm_superpotential} contains terms which break lepton and baryon number conservation, namely $LH_u$, $LLE$ and $LQ\bar D$. If the couplings for these terms are large, they allow for proton decay, which is experimentally very heavily constrained, with a lifetime of $\tau_\mathrm{proton} > 10^{33} ~\mathrm{yr}$ \cite{Agashe:2014kda}. To avoid this, it is conventional to introduce the concept of {\it R-parity}, which gives an explanation for why these couplings are zero.

R-parity is a multiplicative quantum number which is assumed to be conserved in all SUSY interactions. Formally, a particle has R-parity given by
\begin{align}
	R = (-1)^{2s + 3B + L},
\end{align}
where $s$ is the particle's spin, $B$ its baryon number and $L$ its lepton number. The important point is that all Standard Model particles have $R=+1$ while all superpartners have $R = -1$. This leads to the very important prediction that superpartner particles can only be produced and annihilate in pairs. In particular, it means that the lightest superpartner (LSP) must be stable against decay. This makes the LSP very attractive as a candidate for Dark Matter, if it is electrically neutral and has no colour charge. In a SUSY scenario with conservation of R-parity, the supersymmetric particles will typically decay in {\it cascades} down to the LSP, emitting multiple Standard Model particles along the way.

With R-parity, the possible supersymmetry breaking soft terms of the MSSM are, in component fields,
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{soft} = &\left( -\frac{1}{2}M_1 \tilde B \tilde B - \frac{1}{2}M_2 \tilde W^{i,A} \tilde W^i_A - \frac{1}{2}M_3 \tilde g^{a,A}\tilde g^a_A + \mathrm{c.c.} \right)\nonumber\\
  + &\left(-a_{ij}^e \tilde L_i H_d {\tilde e^*}_{iR} - a_{ij}^u \tilde Q_i H_u \tilde u^*_{iR} - a_{ij}^d \tilde Q_i H_d \tilde d^*_{jR} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right)\\
  - &(m_{ij}^L)^2 \tilde L_i^\dag \tilde L_j - (m_{ij}^e)^2 {\tilde e_{iR}^*} {\tilde e_{jR}} - (m_{ij}^Q)^2 \tilde Q_i^\dag \tilde Q_j \nonumber \\
  - &(m_{ij}^u)^2 {\tilde u_{iR}^*} {\tilde u_{jR}} - (m_{ij}^d)^2 {\tilde d_{iR}^*} {\tilde d_{jR}} - m^2_{H_u} H^\dag_u H_u - m^2_{H_d} H^\dag_d H_d.\nonumber
\end{align}
The soft terms constitute the main contributions to the superpartner masses. 

\section{Radiative electroweak symmetry breaking}
\label{sec:REWSB}
The scalar potential of the MSSM Higgs fields is, in terms of component fields,
\begin{align}
	V(H_u, H_d) = 	&|\mu|^2 \left( |H_u^0|^2 + |H_u^+|^2 + |H_d^0|^2 + |H_d^-|^2 \right)\nonumber \\
					&+ \frac{1}{8} \left( g^2 + g'^2 \right) \left( |H_u^0|^2 + |H_u^+|^2 - |H_d^0|^2 - |H_d^-|^2 \right)\nonumber \\
					&+ \frac{1}{2} g^2 |H_u^+ H_d^{0*} + H_u^0 H_d^{-*}|^2\label{eq:mssm_higgspotential}\\
					&+ m_{H_u}^2 \left( |H_u^0|^2 + |H_u^+|^2 \right) + m_{H_d}^2 \left( |H_d^0|^2 + |H_d^+|^2 \right)\nonumber \\
					&+ \left[b\left(H_u^+ H_d^- - H_u^0 H_d^0\right) + \mathrm{c.c.}\right].\nonumber
\end{align}
It can be shown that a necessary and sufficient set of conditions for achieving spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking in this potential is \cite{Martin:1997ns}
\begin{align}
	b^2 &> \left( |\mu|^2 + m_{H_u}^2 \right) \left( |\mu|^2 + m_{H_d}^2 \right),\label{eq:rewsb-cond1}\\
	2b &< 2|\mu|^2 + m_{H_u}^2 + m_{H_d}^2.\label{eq:rewsb-cond2}
\end{align}

Like any quantum field theory, the MSSM is subject to renormalization, which induces the running of the coupling constants and masses of the model as discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:SM_intro}. In particular, the mass parameters $m_{H_{u/d}}$ for the Higgs doublets, which come from soft breaking terms in the Lagrangian, run with energy. To break the electroweak symmetry, {\it i.e.}\ satisfy Eqs.\ \eqref{eq:rewsb-cond1} and \eqref{eq:rewsb-cond2}, one can assume that these are equal at some high scale, and run down. It can be shown that the beta functions which determine the running to lowest order are given by
\begin{align}
	16\pi^2 \beta_{m_{H_u}^2} = 6|y_t|^2\left( m_{H_u}^2 + ( m_{33}^Q)^2 + (m_{33}^u)^2 \right),\\
	16\pi^2 \beta_{m_{H_d}^2} = 6|y_b|^2\left( m_{H_d}^2 + ( m_{33}^Q)^2 + (m_{33}^d)^2 \right),
\end{align}
where $y_t$ and $y_b$ are the top and bottom Yukawa couplings, respectively. Because the top Yukawa coupling is much larger than the bottom one, the $m_{H_u}$ parameter runs down much faster with energy and can become negative, facilitating the symmetry breaking given by Eqs.\ \eqref{eq:rewsb-cond1} and \eqref{eq:rewsb-cond2}. This is called {\it radiative electroweak symmetry breaking}, and gives an explanation for the Higgs mechanism.

As a result of the symmetry breaking, the neutral components of both the Higgs doublets acquire a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value, $v_u = \langle H_u^0 \rangle$ and $v_d = \langle H_d^0 \rangle$, respectively. These must relate to the vector boson masses of the Standard Model as
\begin{align}
	v_u^2 + v_d^2 = \frac{2m_Z^2}{g^2 + g^{'2}} \approx (174 ~\mathrm{GeV})^2.
\end{align}
The remaining free parameter is conventionally parametrized as
\begin{align}
	\tan \beta \equiv \frac{v_u}{v_d}.
\end{align}

 	\caption{Summary of MSSM particle and sparticle content.}
 	\label{table:MSSM_particles}
 \end{table}
The total particle content of the MSSM is as follows: \marginpar{These paragraphs could use a polish, they don't flow well}
The Standard Model particles are present: electrons, muons, taus and their corresponding neutrinos, the up, down, strange, charm, bottom and top quarks, the photon, Z boson and W bosons and gluons, and the Higgs boson. 
In addition to the Standard Model Higgs $h$, there are four other scalar Higgs particles with positive R-parity, labeled $H$, $H^\pm$ and $A$. $H$ is identical to $h$ except for its larger mass, and is therefore termed ``heavy Higgs'', in contrast to the ``light Higgs'' $h$ of the Standard Model. The other neutral field $A$ is a pseudo-scalar.

All the Standard Model particles get superpartners, often termed {\it sparticles}. For the gluons, they are called gluinos and labeled $\tilde g$. The partners of the $B^0$ and $W^a$ fields, which in the Standard Model make up the photon, $Z$ and $W^\pm$, mix with the superpartner Higgs fields to form four neutral Majorana fermions called neutralinos, labeled $\tilde\chi_i^0$, $i=1,...,4$, and two charged fermion-antifermion pairs called charginos, $\tilde\chi_i^\pm$, $i=1,2$. Each of the Standard Model fermions get two corresponding scalar particles with the same gauge charges. For the first two generations, the mass matrix is to good approximation diagonal in the basis spanned by the superpartner fields to the chiral Weyl fermions, so {\it e.g.}\ the superpartners of the up quark $u$ are labeled $\tilde u_R$ and $\tilde u_L$. For the third-generation fermions, the chiral approximation is cruder, so these mass eigenstates are just numbered, {\it e.g.}\ $\tilde b_1$ and $\tilde b_2$ for the $b$ quark. A summary of the MSSM particle content is shown in Table \ref{table:MSSM_particles}.

The fact that superpartner fields inherit the couplings of their Standard Model counterparts is very useful when drawing Feynman diagrams for processes, since intuition from the Standard Model can be applied through {\it supersymmetrization} of the diagrams. For instance, the fermion-fermion-gauge boson vertices (Fig.\ \ref{fig:feynmandiagram_supersymmetrization_a}) of the Standard Model have supersymmetrized fermion-sfermion-gaugino and sfermion-sfermion-gauge boson versions (figs.\ \ref{fig:feynmandiagram_supersymmetrization} b and c). However, sfermion-sfermion-gaugino does not exist, because of R-parity.

\end{figure}

An important consequence of the coupling inheritance is that the gaugino fields $\tilde\chi_i^{0/\pm}$ will couple differently depending on the mass mixing matrix for these states. Since the wino field inherits the left-chiral $SU(2)_L$ coupling, the chirality of the couplings of the four neutralinos may differ considerably if the mass eigenstates are close to the gauge eigenstates. In the parameter point used for the analysis in the coming chapters, the second-generation neutralino consists of a large wino part, and this means that it has a small coupling to right-chiral quarks. 

 \subsection{Sparticle masses}
 The main contributions to the sparticle masses naturally come from the soft terms, since these are responsible for the symmetry breaking which would otherwise give Standard Model masses to sparticles. The mass parameters from these terms are the gaugino mass terms $M_{1,2,3}$, the sfermion mass terms $m_{ij}$ and the Higgs terms $m_{H_{u/d}}$. Additionally, the parameter $\mu$ from the superpotential term coupling the Higgs doublets together in the unbroken SUSY Lagrangian contributes \cite{Martin:1997ns}.
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item At tree level, the different Higgs masses (which have positive R-parity) are
 	\begin{align}
 		m_A^2 &= 2|\mu|^2 + m^2_{H_u} + m^2_{H_d},\label{eq:mssm_higgs_masses1}\\
 		m^2_{h,H} &= \frac{1}{2} \left( m_A^2 + m_Z^2 \pm \sqrt{(m_A^2 - m_Z^2)^2 + 4m_Z^2m_A^2\sin^2 2\beta} \right),\label{eq:mssm_higgs_masses2}\\
 		m^2_{H^\pm} &= m_A^2 + m_W^2.
 	\end{align}
 	\item The gluino mass $m_{\tilde g}$ is given as
 	\begin{align}
 		m_{\tilde g} = M_3 \left[ 1 + \frac{\alpha_s}{4\pi}\left( 15 + 6\ln\frac{\mu}{M_3} + \sum_{\mathrm{all} ~\tilde q} A_{\tilde q} \right)\right],
 	\end{align}
 	where $A_{\tilde q}$ are the significant squark one-loop contributions given by
 	\begin{align}
 		A_{\tilde q} = \int_0^1 dx \, x \ln\left( x \frac{m^2_{\tilde q}}{M_3^2} + (1-x)\frac{m_q^2}{M_3^2} - x(1-x) - i\epsilon \right).
 	\end{align}
 	\item The neutralinos $\tilde\chi_i^0$ are the mass eigenstates of the bino, wino and higgsino fields. In the gauge eigenstate basis, where $\tilde\chi^{0} = (\tilde B^0, \tilde W^0, \tilde H_d^0, \tilde H_u^0)^T$, the mass matrix may be written at tree level as
 	\begin{align}
 		M_{\tilde \chi^0} = \begin{pmatrix}
 			M_1 & 0 & - c_\beta s_{\theta_W} m_Z &  s_\beta s_{\theta_W} m_Z \\
 			0 & M_2 &  c_\beta c_{\theta_W} m_Z & - s_\beta c_{\theta_W} m_Z\\
 			- c_\beta s_{\theta_W} m_Z &  s_\beta s_{\theta_W} m_Z & 0 & -\mu \\
			 c_\beta c_{\theta_W} m_Z & - s_\beta c_{\theta_W} m_Z & -\mu & 0
 		\end{pmatrix},
 	\end{align}
 	where $c_x = \cos x$ and $s_x = \sin x$. For a given parameter choice, this matrix must be diagonalized to find the neutralino masses and field content.
 	\item The charginos $\tilde\chi_i^\pm$ have analogous structure. In the gauge eigenstate basis $\tilde \chi^{\pm} = (\tilde W^+, \tilde H_u^+, \tilde W^-, \tilde H_d^-)^T$, the mass matrix is
 	\begin{align}
 		M_{\tilde \chi^\pm} = \begin{pmatrix}
 			0 & 0 & M_2 & \sqrt{2} c_\beta m_W  \\
 			0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} s_\beta m_W & \mu \\
 			M_2 & \sqrt{2} s_\beta m_W & 0 & 0\\
 			\sqrt{2} s_\beta m_W & \mu & 0 & 0
 		\end{pmatrix}.
 	\end{align}
 	\item The first two generations of {\it sfermions}, superpartners of the Standard Model fermions, get masses according to
 	\begin{align}
 		m^2_F = m^2_{F,\mathrm{soft}} + \Delta_F,
 	\end{align}
 	where $m^2_{F,\mathrm{soft}}$ is the mass term from the soft term of the form $-m^2_F F^\dag F$ and $\Delta_F$ is given by
 	\begin{align}
 		\Delta_F = (T_{3F} - Q_F \sin^2\theta_W)\cos 2\beta \, m^2_Z,
 	\end{align}
 	where $T_{3F}$ and $Q_F$ are the weak isospin and electric charge, respectively, of the left-handed supermultiplet to which the sfermion belongs. The masses are then {\it e.g.}\
 	\begin{align}
 		&m^2_{\tilde e_L} = m^2_{L_1} + \Delta \tilde e_L,\\
 		&m^2_{\tilde e_R} = m^2_{e_R} + \Delta \tilde e_R.
 	\end{align}
 	The mass-splitting between same-generation sleptons and squarks are universal and given by {\it e.g.}\ %\marginpar{Is it the same for right-handeds? Check, or don't mention?}
 	\begin{align}
 		m^2_{\tilde e_L} - m^2_{\tilde \nu_L} = m^2_{\tilde d_L} - m^2_{\tilde u_L} = -\cos 2\beta \, m_W^2.
 	\end{align}
 	\item The third-generation sfermions have more complicated mass contributions, {\it e.g.}\ the stop squark mass matrix in the chiral gauge eigenstate basis $\tilde t = (\tilde t_L, \tilde t_R)^T$ is given by
 	\begin{align}
 		m^2_{\tilde t} = \begin{pmatrix}
 			m^2_{Q_3} + m_t^2 + \Delta \tilde u_L & v((a_{33}^u)^* \sin\beta - \mu y_t \cos\beta)\\
 			v(a_{33}^u \sin\beta - \mu^* y_t \cos\beta) & m^2_{u3} + m^2_t + \Delta \tilde u_R
 		\end{pmatrix},
 	\end{align}
 	which can be diagonalized to find the mass eigenstates. The reason that the third-generation sfermions have more complicated mass matrices is that the Yukawa and trilinear couplings are larger, giving non-negligible contributions to the masses.
 \end{itemize}

 \section{Gauge unification and mass hierarchies}
 It was mentioned in Section \ref{sec:motivations_for_extending_the_SM} that one very appealing feature of supersymmetry is that the coupling constants of the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions can be made to unite at a high energy scale. In the MSSM, this scale, called the ``grand unification scale'' (GUT), is $m_\mathrm{GUT} \approx 2\times 10^{16} ~\mathrm{GeV}$. If we assume that the grand unified gauge group is $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$,\footnote{$SO(n)$ is the {\it special orthogonal group} given in the defining matrix representation as the group of all orthogonal $n\times n$ matrices of determinant one.}, then we can take the three gauge couplings of the grand unified theory to be \cite{Batzing:2013}
 \begin{align}
 	g_1 = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}g', \quad g_2 = g, \quad g_3 = g_s.
 \end{align}
 It can be shown that the one-loop $\beta$-functions of the gauge couplings $g_i$ and the gaugino soft mass parameters $M_i$ are
 \begin{align}
 	\beta_{g_i}|_\mathrm{1-loop} &= \frac{1}{16\pi^2} b_i g_i^3,\\
 	\beta_{M_i} |_\mathrm{1-loop} &= \frac{1}{8\pi^2}g_i^2 M_i b_i.
 \end{align}
The ratios $M_i/g_i^2$ for all three parameter pairs are scale independent at one-loop order. To see this, it is convenent to write the $\beta$-functions as 
 \begin{align}
 	\beta_X \equiv \frac{d}{dt}X,
 \end{align}
 for a running variable $X$, where $t = \log \mu$ is the {\it scale parameter} for the renormalization scale $\mu$. If we define
 \begin{align}
 	R = \frac{M_i}{g_i^2},
 \end{align}
 then
 \begin{align}
 	\beta_R = \frac{dR}{dt} &= \frac{(\frac{d}{dt}M_i)g_i^2 - M_i\frac{d}{dt}g_i^2}{g_i^4} = 0, \nonumber
 \end{align}
 which proves the claim. 

 By assuming that the coupling constants $g_i$ unite to the value $g_u$ at the GUT scale, and that the gaugino masses $M_i$ have the common value $m_{1/2}$ at the same scale, then it follows that
 \begin{align}
 	\frac{M_1}{g_1^2} = \frac{M_2}{g_2^2} = \frac{M_3}{g_3^2} = \frac{m_{1/2}}{g_u}.
 \end{align}
 In terms of the electromagnetic and strong fine-structure constants $\alpha$ and $\alpha_s$, and the weak mixing angle $\theta_W$, this gives
 \begin{align}
 	M_3 = \frac{\alpha_s}{\alpha}\sin^2\theta_W M_2 = \frac{3}{5}\frac{\alpha_s}{\alpha} \cos^2\theta_W M_1.
 \end{align}
 At a scale of $1 ~\mathrm{TeV}$, this evaluates to approximately
 \begin{align}
 	M_3 : M_2 : M_1 \approxeq 6 : 2 : 1.
 \end{align}
 This propagates into the mass formulae to predict the approximate mass relationships
 \begin{align}
 	m_{\tilde g} \approx 6m_{\tilde \chi_1^0} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad m_{\tilde \chi_2^0} \approx m_{\tilde \chi_1^\pm} \approx 2m_{\tilde \chi_1^0}.
 \end{align}

\section{The Constrained MSSM}
\label{sec:cmssm}
The available parameter space of the general MSSM is very large, of the order 100 free parameters. The reason for the vast number of parameters are the soft supersymmetry breaking terms, which contain coupling parameters for all the extra terms without any {\it a priori} way to relate them. It is therefore conventional to make some restricting assumptions. A much-studied restriction is the {\it Constrained MSSM} (CMSSM), also known as {\it minimal supergravity} (mSUGRA). This model is constructed by assuming that supersymmetry breaking is mediated by some mechanism of gravity at the Planck scale of $M_P = 2.4\times 10^{18} ~\mathrm{GeV}$. By assuming a minimal form for the parameters at the GUT scale, to obtain gauge unification, the resulting model is parametrized in terms of five parameters,
\begin{align}
	m_{1/2}, \, m_{0}, \, A_0, \, \tan\beta ~\mathrm{and} ~\mathrm{sign}(\mu).
\end{align}
The mass parameters $m_{1/2}$ and $m_0$ are the common soft masses of all gauginos and sfermions, respectively, at the GUT scale. The mass splitting between sparticles appears when the individual sparticle masses are evolved down to a lower scale.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/susyintro/MSSMrun.eps}
	\caption{MSSM RG-running, from \cite{Martin:1997ns}. In this figure, $m_0 = 200 ~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $m_{1/2}= 600 ~\mathrm{GeV}$.}
	\label{fig:mssm_rgerun}
\end{figure}
This is illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mssm_rgerun} for one choice of $m_{1/2}$ and $m_0$. The figure also illustrates the evolution of $m_{H_u}$ down to a negative value, facilitating the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking discussed in Section \ref{sec:REWSB}.

Because the renormalization running is proportional to the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model partners, the sfermion partners will often get an inverted mass hierarchy compared to the Standard Model. Especially in the colour sector, where stop and sbottom are often the lightest squarks. However, the effect may be compensated by mixing terms, and the first and second generation mass splittings are small or even degenerate, since the masses are dominated by the common soft mass terms. Since all the sfermion masses evolve from the common mass $m_0$, the squarks will typically be heavier than the sleptons in CMSSM because the running of the former is affected by QCD interactions. Also, because the $SU(3)$ coupling $g_3$ influences the RG-running of $m_{\tilde q}$, typically $m_{\tilde q} \approx m_{\tilde g}$.

This thesis studies a particular type of cascade decay chain, namely
\begin{align}
	\tilde q \to \tilde\chi_2^0q \to \tilde l l q \to \tilde \chi_1^0 ll q.	\label{eq:susyintrochap_cascade}
\end{align}
which exhibits several features which enable determination of SUSY mass parameters. For this chain to be available to study in a CMSSM parameter point, the following conditions must be satisfied: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The mass hierarchy must be $m_{\tilde q} > m_{\tilde\chi_2^0} > m_{\tilde l} > m_{\tilde\chi_1^0}$.
	\item The gluino must be as heavy or heavier than the squarks, to disable the $\tilde q \to \tilde g q$ channel, which otherwise dominates over the chain process.
	\item All the intermediate particles must have sizeable branching fractions to the subsequent chain particles.
\end{enumerate}
In \cite{Gjelsten:2004ki} it is shown that these conditions are indeed satisfied in large parts of the CMSSM parameter space. Figure \ref{fig:mSUGRA_decay_spectrum} shows plots of a selection of the CMSSM parameter space, indicating different mass hierarchies. The green areas have the correct hierarchy for the chain and the right LSP. The darker green area inside it additionally has a sizeable branching fraction into the chain, {\it i.e.}\ more than 10\% of the branching at the SPS1a benchmark point defined in \cite{Allanach:2002nj}, which is marked and denoted $\alpha$ in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mSUGRA_decay_spectrum_a}. Regions where a charged particle (the stau) is the LSP are excluded. The SPS1a point is the benchmark point that will be used in subsequent chapters.

\subsection{The SPS1a benchmark point}
\label{sec:sps1a_benchmark_point}\marginpar{Estimate chain event yield}
The SPS1a benchmark point is defined in \cite{Allanach:2002nj} as the CMSSM point with $m_0=100~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{1/2}=250~\mathrm{GeV}$, $A_0=-100~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\tan \beta = 10$ and $\mu > 0$. The point is actually defined as the MSSM parameters obtained by using {\tt ISAJET 7.58} \cite{Baer:1999sp} to RG-run down from the defining CMSSM parameters. In this thesis we will instead use the parameters obtained by using {\tt SOFTSUSY 3.4.1} \cite{Allanach:2001kg} for RG-running. This gives a slightly different mass spectrum, but the main features are the same. Figure \ref{fig:SPS1a_softsusy_spectrum} shows the mass and decay spectrum of the SPS1a point in {\tt SOFTSUSY}. The dashed lines indicate the decay channels, and the line width is proportional to the branching ratio. Decays with a branching ratio of less than 1\% are not shown.
\begin{figure}[hbt]

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/susyintro/softsusy_sps1a_with_branchings_original.pdf}
  \caption{The mass spectrum of SPS1a from {\tt SOFTSUSY}. The dashed lines show the decay channels. The figure is made using {\tt PySLHA 3.0.2} \cite{Buckley:2013jua}. See the text for details.}
  \label{fig:SPS1a_softsusy_spectrum}
\end{figure}
Among the features to note is that the right-handed squarks have a much smaller branching ratio to $\tilde \chi_2^0$ than the left-handeds: 1\% and 30\%, respectively. This limits the amount of right-handed squarks initiating the chain, which is helpful for mass reconstruction since it limits the mass splitting between the squarks in the chain. Also, the left-handed sleptons are heavier than $\tilde \chi_2^0$, switching off that decay channel and limiting the slepton mass splitting. The branching fractions of the $\chi_2^0$ are divided between the the different $\tilde l l$ decay modes, with nearly 90\% branching to $\tilde \tau \tau$ and the rest evenly divided between $\tilde e e$ and $\tilde \mu \mu$. Because the tau is short-lived and has a large branching fraction to hadrons (65\%) \cite{Agashe:2014kda}, it is difficult to use the cascade events which contain a tau for kinematical analysis, and this limits the number of useful chain events at SPS1a.

\section{The experimental status of supersymmetry}
The search for supersymmetric particles is one of the main activities ongoing at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, particularly in the general purpose ATLAS and CMS experiments. Before the LHC was turned off for maintenance and upgrades at the end of 2012, each experiment had collected $\sim 20 ~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data at a centre-of-momentum energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8~\mathrm{TeV}$ in what is called LHC Run~I. No significant excesses of events that could indicate the existence of SUSY have so far been observed, with the exception of a few minor deviations in data that do not reach the level required for a discovery, the most significant being a $3\sigma$ excess in events consistent with a $Z$-boson, missing energy and jets~\cite{Aad:2015wqa}. At the time of writing, the LHC has begun circulating beams in preparation for Run II, which will achieve a centre-of-momentum energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$, and is expected to record $\sim 300 ~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data over the next ten years. In an even longer perspective, an upgrade to the {\it high luminosity LHC} is planned, which brings the total expected integrated luminosity up to $3000~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 14~\mathrm{TeV}$. 

The discovery of a Higgs boson with~\cite{Aad:2015zhl}
\begin{equation}
m_h = 125.09\,\pm 0.21\, (\rm{stat.})\pm\, 0.11\, (\rm{syst.})~{\rm GeV,}
\label{eq:higgsmass}
\end{equation}
has important implications for supersymmetry. If we assume that it is the light SM-like Higgs of the MSSM, Eqs.\ (\ref{eq:mssm_higgs_masses1}) and (\ref{eq:mssm_higgs_masses2}) restrict combinations of the Higgs potential parameters $|\mu|$, $\tan\beta$ and $m^2_{H_{u/d}}$ at tree level. In corrections to its mass at loop-level, this Higgs impacts even more supersymmetric particles, in particular those with large couplings, such as the stop squark, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:motivations_for_extending_the_SM} and Appendix \ref{appendix:higgs_mass_loop_correction}.

Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_mSUGRA} shows the current reach of ATLAS in the CMSSM model which we discussed in Section \ref{sec:cmssm}. The plot shows the $(m_0,m_{1/2})$ plane for fixed values of $\tan\beta = 30$, $A_0 = -2m_0$ and $\mu>0$. The choice of $\tan\beta$ and $A_0$ is made to accomodate a large Higgs mass consistent with (\ref{eq:higgsmass}), here shown as dashed--dotted blue lines. The various coloured (solid) lines indicate the lower bound for the parameter combination at the 95\% confidence level in different searches, while the dashed lines are the expected exclusion limits for the given data assuming only the Standard Model. We see that for low values of $m_0$, where the decay chain in eq.~(\ref{eq:susyintrochap_cascade}) exists, searches for events with multiple jets and no leptons put the most constraining limits on the $m_{1/2}$ parameter.

Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_neutralinogluino} shows the same kinds of exclusion limits, but now in the $(m_{\tilde q/\tilde g}, m_{\tilde \chi_1^0})$ mass plane for the MSSM. These searches assume simplified models with the mass hierarchy $m_{\tilde q/\tilde g} > m_{\tilde \chi_2^0} > m_{\tilde l} > m_{\tilde \chi_1^0}$ and all other sparticles decoupled.\footnote{Only the squarks of the first two generations are included. The third generation squarks are assumed to be decoupled.} The events considered in this analysis are required to have two (a) and four (b) jets, respectively, where none of the jets have been tagged as $b$-jets. Additionally, there must be two leptons of opposite sign and same flavour, which are not allowed to have an invariant mass between them that is compatible with a $Z$ boson decaying. Also, there must be a significant amount $(> 200 ~\mathrm{GeV})$ of missing transverse energy. We see that for a $\tilde \chi_1^0$ with mass below 200 GeV, squarks below 800 GeV are excluded, and below 300 GeV, gluinos below 1200 GeV are ruled out, thus putting considerable constraints on the decay chain we are interested in.

Referring back to Fig.\ \ref{fig:mSUGRA_decay_spectrum}, we see that the bright green region, where the chain hierarchy is present with a sizeable branching fraction, favours low values for $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$ in the CMSSM. Comparing to the experimental constraints of figure \ref{fig:ATLAS_mSUGRA}, we see that much of these parts of the parameter space are ruled out. In particular we note that the SPS1a point is excluded. The top left region, where $m_{1/2} \gtrsim 800~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $1000 ~\mathrm{GeV} \gtrsim m_0 \gtrsim 400 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, is compatible with the green areas of Fig.\ \ref{fig:mSUGRA_decay_spectrum} and is not ruled out by the ATLAS limits themselves, but it corresponds to a Higgs mass $m_h \lesssim 123 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, which is somewhat far from the measured value in (\ref{eq:higgsmass}). However, it should be noted that current state-of-the-art calculations of the Higgs mass in the MSSM (and CMSSM) come with theoretical errors of the order of 2 GeV~\cite{Heinemeyer:2015dsa}, thus this region is not {\it per se} ruled out. There is also a question of what values are chosen for $A_0$ and $\tan\beta$, since the searches in Fig.\ \ref{fig:ATLAS_mSUGRA} assume one specific choice. Tuning these parameters may bring closer agreement with the Higgs mass, but this has not been investigated here since it would require a full re-evaluation of the ATLAS searches.

As a benchmark for the event yield of the chain (\ref{eq:susyintrochap_cascade}), we have calculated the expected number of events in which there are two such chains, for the parameter point $m_0 = 400 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{1/2} = 800 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, $A_0 = -800~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\tan\beta = 30$, $\mu>0$ for LHC Run II. This is the lowest $(m_0,m_{1/2})$ combination that is not excluded by Fig.\ \ref{fig:ATLAS_mSUGRA} and at the same time provides the conditions needed for the chain. We calculate sparticle masses and branching fractions using {\tt SOFTSUSY 3.4.1} \cite{Allanach:2001kg} and squark and gluino cross-sections for 13 TeV LHC using {\tt NLL-fast 3.0} \cite{Beenakker:1996ch,Kulesza:2008jb,Kulesza:2009kq,Beenakker:2009ha,Beenakker:2011fu,Beenakker:1997ut,Beenakker:2010nq}. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ for a high-luminosity upgraded LHC,\footnote{The high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC will probably take data at $\sqrt{s}=14~\mathrm{TeV}$. There is, however, no complete implementation of {\tt NLL-fast} for $14 ~\mathrm{TeV}$.} we find an expectation of 2.12 events.

In experiments at the LHC, one has to apply {\it cuts} to the data to isolate the signal. This further reduces the expected signal yield. We have used {\tt Pythia 8.2} \cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} to estimate the fraction of events at the aforementioned parameter point which has two instances of the decay chain and pass a set of cut criteria given by: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item At least two jets with $p_T > 200~\mathrm{GeV}$, $|\eta|<2.5$.
	\item All four leptons have $p_T > 20~\mathrm{GeV}$.
	\item There is missing $p_T > 100~\mathrm{GeV}$.
\end{itemize}
We find that about 90\% of the events pass these cuts.

To match the measured Higgs mass and avoid the ATLAS direct searches, and at the same time keep the conditions needed for the chain as illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mSUGRA_decay_spectrum}, it appears that both the $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$ parameters need to be pushed to or above 1000 GeV. Increasing the sparticle masses reduces the production cross-section, which means that even an expectation of 2 events may be optimistic. Thus, it seems that it will be difficult to measure the golden decay chain in the CMSSM at the LHC in a way that will be useful in the present context.

By loosening some of the constraining assumptions of the CMSSM, such as the soft mass unification at a high scale, more general parametrizations of SUSY may be defined. The failure of the LHC to find signs of supersymmetry has prompted a large interest in studies of these more general models, in particular those  termed ``Natural SUSY'', since the main guiding principle is to avoid the need for fine-tuning, such as the {\it little hierarchy problem} of the Higgs mass discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix:higgs_mass_loop_correction}. In these more general models, the squark and/or gluino masses may decouple, {\it e.g.}\ pushing the gluino and third generation squarks to high masses, while retaining light squarks of the two first generations. This may evade experimental constraints on the Higgs mass, and still give relatively large cross-sections for squark production to initiate the chain. However, one would still be subject to the constraints shown in fig.~\ref{fig:ATLAS_neutralinogluino} (a). As a benchmark for this scenario, we have used {\tt NLL-fast} to find the squark-pair production cross-section at 14 TeV LHC, in the decoupling limit of large gluino mass. Assuming $m_{\tilde q} = 850~\mathrm{GeV}$, we get $\sigma_{\tilde q \tilde q} = 0.258~\mathrm{pb}$. If we assume that all the particles in our decay chain have 100\% branching to subsequent chain particles, as a best-case scenario, then the expected event yield with an integrated luminosity of $3000~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ is 774000 events.

% There are also other experimental signatures that can be used to set limits on SUSY parameters. One notable example is the branching fraction for the decay $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, which has a would-be SUSY contribution which is heavily dependent on $\tan\beta$. So far, analyses by the CMS and LHCb groups \cite{CMS:2014xfa} have found results which match the predictions of the Standard Model to high precision, thus placing stringent limits on any non-Standard Model contributions. \marginpar{Remove this paragraph?}

\section{The problem}
Consider an LHC event where two chains of the form
\begin{align}
	\tilde q \to \tilde\chi_2^0q \to \tilde l l q \to \tilde \chi_1^0 ll q\label{eq:goldencascade}
\end{align}
are present. Combined, the measurable particles in the two chains are the two quarks and four leptons, where the lepton pairs are opposite-sign same-flavour. The LSPs escape detection, but the sum of their transverse momenta can be measured as the missing $p_T$. The quantities of interest, however, are the masses of the supersymmetric particles, $m_{\tilde{q}}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0}, m_{\tilde{l}}$ and $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}$. Potentially with several values for the squarks and sleptons if they differ in generation and/or chirality between the sides. These masses are not directly measurable, but the kinematics of the problem depend on them. 

Many methods have been investigated for the purpose of measuring supersymmetric masses \cite{Barr:2010zj}. One well known example is the end-point method \cite{1126-6708-2000-09-004}. We measure {\it e.g.}\ the dilepton invariant mass in the process \eqref{eq:goldencascade}. The distribution of the dilepton invariant mass can be shown to form a right triangle where the maximal value is given by
\begin{align}
	(m_{ll}^\mathrm{max})^2 = \frac{ \left( m^2_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0} - m^2_{\tilde{l}} \right) \left( m^2_{\tilde{l}} - m^2_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} \right)}{m^2_{\tilde{l}}}, \label{eq:invariant_mass_endpoint}
\end{align}
thus constraining $m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0}$, $m_{\tilde{l}}$ and $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}$. Similar constraints may be obtained for the three other visible particle combinations, giving four equations with four unknowns. This method is very dependent on statistics, since each measured event only contributes one point to the distribution. A large number of events is required to get a reliable value. However, the number of events contributing to the measurement is also much larger, since each side of the decay chain contribute individually, thus making use of events with leptons on one side only as well.



\section{Webber's method}
Webber \cite{Webber:2009vm} suggests a different method, where all available kinematical info from every event is used. Consider the general decay tree in fig. \ref{fig:decaytree}. We assume that we have an event with two such chains, but not necessarily with identical particles in the two. We will distinguish the two chains by referring to them as the ``first'' and ``second'' one, although the assignment is arbitrary.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/fig-chain.pdf} % Stolen!
\caption{Decay topology, from \cite{Miller:2005zp}.}
\label{fig:decaytree}
\end{figure}
Assuming that the decaying particles are on-shell, the four-momenta in the first chain should satisfy
\begin{align}
	(p_c + p_b + p_a + p_A)^2 &= M_D^2,\nonumber \\
	(p_b + p_a + p_A)^2 &= M_C^2,\nonumber \\
	(p_a + p_A)^2 &= M_B^2,\label{eq:constraints}\\
	p_A^2 &= M_A^2.\nonumber
\end{align}
The first three equations give three linear constraints on the invisible four-momentum $p_A$:
\begin{align}
	-2p_c\cdot p_A &= M_C^2 - M_D^2 + 2p_c\cdot p_b + 2p_c \cdot p_a + m_c^2 \equiv S_1,\label{eq:constraints_projections1} \\
	-2p_b\cdot p_A &= M_B^2 - M_C^2 + 2p_b\cdot p_a + m_b^2 \equiv S_2,\\
	-2p_a\cdot p_A &= M_A^2 - M_B^2 + m_a^2 \equiv S_3.
\end{align}
Physically, these correspond to projections of the invisible particles on the measured ones. Equivalently the second chain (with primed indices) gets the constraints
\begin{align}
	-2p_{c'}\cdot p_{A'} &= M_{C'}^2 - M_{D'}^2 + 2p_{c'}\cdot p_{b'} + 2p_{c'} \cdot p_{a'} + m_{c'}^2 \equiv S_5, \\ 
	-2p_{b'}\cdot p_{A'} &= M_{B'}^2 - M_{C'}^2 + 2p_{b'}\cdot p_{a'} + m_{b'}^2 \equiv S_6,\\
	-2p_{a'}\cdot p_{A'} &= M_{A'}^2 - M_{B'}^2 + m_{a'}^2 \equiv S_7.\label{eq:constraints_projections6}
\end{align}
In addition we have the transverse momentum constraints
\begin{align}
	p_A^x + p_{A'}^x &= p_\mathrm{miss}^x \equiv S_4, \label{eq:Svec_orig} \\
	p_A^y + p_{A'}^y &= p_\mathrm{miss}^y \equiv S_8. \nonumber
\end{align}

The vector $\mathbf{S} = (S_1, S_2, ...)$ thus depends on the eight unknown masses 
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{M} = (M_D^2, M_C^2, M_B^2, M_{A'}^2, M_{D'}^2, M_{C'}^2, M_{B'}^2, M_{A'}^2)
\end{align}
and the visible momenta, which in principle are measurable. We define a vector containing the four-momenta of the invisible final state particles as
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{P} = (p_A^x, p_A^y, p_A^z, E_A, p_{A'}^x, p_{A'}^y, p_{A'}^z, E_{A'}). \label{eq:Pvec}
\end{align}
We then have
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{A}\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{S},\label{eq:APS}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{A} = 2 \begin{pmatrix}
						p_c^x & p_c^y & p_c^z & -E_c & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_b^x & p_b^y & p_b^z & -E_b & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_a^x & p_a^y & p_a^z & -E_a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						1/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{c'}^x & p_{c'}^y & p_{c'}^z & -E_{c'} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{b'}^x & p_{b'}^y & p_{b'}^z & -E_{b'} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{a'}^x & p_{a'}^y & p_{a'}^z & -E_{a'} \\
						0 & 1/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 & 0 & 0
					\end{pmatrix}. \label{eq:Amatrix_orig}
\end{align}
Furthermore, $\mathbf{S}$ may be written as 
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{C},\label{eq:SBMC}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix}
					-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
is a sparse matrix, and
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{C} = ( &2p_c \cdot p_b + 2p_c \cdot p_a + m_c^2, 2 p_2 \cdot p_3 + m_b^2, m_a^2, p_\mathrm{miss}^x, \nonumber \\ 
				   &2p_{c'}\cdot p_{b'} + 2 p_{c'} \cdot p_{a'} + m_{c'}^2, 2 p_{b'} \cdot p_{a'} + m_{b'}^2, m_{a'}^2, p_\mathrm{miss}^y ).
\end{align}
With all of this, the solution for the invisible four-momenta, given the unknown masses, is 
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{S} = \mathbf{D} \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{E},
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{C}$.

The matrix $\mathbf{D}$ and vector $\mathbf{E}$ contain only measurable quantities, hence they only need to be calculated once for every event. For the true value of the unknown masses $\mathbf{M}$, the system should satisfy the on-shell conditions
\begin{align}
	p_{A}^2 &= P_4^2 - P_1 ^2 - P_2^2 - P_3^2 = M_{A}^2, \nonumber\\
	p_{A'}^2 &= P_8^2 - P_5 ^2 - P_6^2 - P_7^2 = M_{A'}^2.
\end{align}
So by calculating $\mathbf{D}_n$ and $\mathbf{E}_n$ for each event $n$, and making a {\it hypothesis} $\mathbf{M}$ for the unknown masses, we can measure the goodness of fit for our hypothesis by the quantity
\begin{align}
	\xi^2(\mathbf{M}) = \sum_n \left[(p_{A}^2)_n - M_A^2\right]^2 + \left[(p_{A'}^2)_n - M_{A'}^2\right]^2. \label{eq:xisquared}
\end{align}
Note that this quantity measures the goodness-of-fit of all the unknown masses equally, since it follows from the constraint equations \eqref{eq:constraints} that for example
\begin{align}
	(p_B^2)_n - M_B^2 &= (p_a + p_A)_n^2 - M_B^2 \nonumber\\
				  &= (p_a^2)_n + (p_A^2)_n + 2p_a\cdot p_A - M_B^2\nonumber\\
				  &= (p_a^2)_n + (p_A^2)_n - M_A^2 + M_B^2 - m_a^2 - M_B^2\\
				  &= (p_A^2)_n - M_A^2.\nonumber
\end{align}

For each event there are eight constraining equations. There are eight unknowns from the masses plus six from the unknown LSP momenta (using the on-shell constraint on the LSPs). The system is thus underconstrained, with six free parameters. The point of the method is to minimize $\xi^2$ as a function of $\mathbf{M}$. This is generally an eight-dimensional minimization problem with a potentially very complicated behaviour, and thus not easy to solve. However, in the case of identical chains, it reduces to a much more handleable four-dimensional one which one could hope could be solved. In this case the number of free parameters reduces from six to two. The condition of identical chains can often be satisfied by a combination of vetoing ({\it e.g.} b-jets) and assuming small mass splittings between different generations, thus approximating their masses as equal. As was discussed in Section \ref{sec:cmssm}, this is a realistic assumption in many SUSY scenarios. Note that because the system is underconstrained, more than one event is needed to be able to solve for the masses.

\section{Two technical modifications}\label{sec:dimension_fixing}
For the method to be applicable, the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ must be invertible. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is non-zero. However, the matrix $\mathbf A$ as it stands in \eqref{eq:Amatrix_orig} as defined by Webber \cite{Webber:2009vm}, is technically ill-defined for inversion since not all rows have the same units. The rows 4 and 8, corresponding to the components 4 and 8 of the vector $\mathbf{S}$, have no dimension, while the other rows have dimension $[\mathrm{mass}]^1$. This is reflected in the components of $\mathbf{S}$, where all, except 4 and 8, have dimension $[\mathrm{mass}]^2$. This means both that the magnitude of the determinant is sensitive to the choice of mass scale, since some rows have non-zero dimension, and that it does not scale properly for numerical calculations, since not all rows have the same dimension. This is something that Webber does not comment on, and although it is more sensitive to numerical instability the method still in principle works, but we make some minor reformulations of the method in order to amend both problems.

For the first, we redefine $S_4$ and $S_8$ to be 
\begin{align}
	S_4 &\equiv (p_A^x + p_{A'}^x)^2 = (p_\mathrm{miss}^x)^2, \label{eq:Svec_modified} \\
	S_8 &\equiv (p_A^y + p_{A'}^y)^2 = (p_\mathrm{miss}^y)^2. \nonumber
\end{align}
We do not wish to redefine $\mathbf{P}$ \eqref{eq:Pvec}, so to keep the relationship $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{P}$ we modify rows 4 and 8 of $\mathbf{A}$ to
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{A}_4 &= (p_\mathrm{miss}^x, 0, 0, 0, p_\mathrm{miss}^x, 0, 0, 0),\\
	\mathbf{A}_8 &= (0, p_\mathrm{miss}^y, 0, 0, 0, p_\mathrm{miss}^y, 0, 0),\nonumber
\end{align}
so that $\mathbf{A}$ now is
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{A} = 2 \begin{pmatrix}
						p_c^x & p_c^y & p_c^z & -E_c & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_b^x & p_b^y & p_b^z & -E_b & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_a^x & p_a^y & p_a^z & -E_a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_\mathrm{miss}^x/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_\mathrm{miss}^x/2 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{c'}^x & p_{c'}^y & p_{c'}^z & -E_{c'} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{b'}^x & p_{b'}^y & p_{b'}^z & -E_{b'} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{a'}^x & p_{a'}^y & p_{a'}^z & -E_{a'} \\
						0 & p_\mathrm{miss}^y/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_\mathrm{miss}^y/2 & 0 & 0
					\end{pmatrix}. \label{eq:Amatrix_modified}
\end{align}

This redefinition does not alter the solvability of the problem, since the only information lost in $\mathbf{S}$ is the sign of $p_\mathrm{miss}^i$ which is kept in $\mathbf{A}$ instead. Also it keeps the essential feature that $\mathbf{A}$ only contains measured quantities, so that it can be inverted prior to making a mass hypothesis. The redefinition of $\mathbf{S}$ means we also have to modify $\mathbf{C}$ to keep the relationship $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{C}$ from Eq.\ \eqref{eq:SBMC}. We make the same redefinitions here, {\it i.e.}
\begin{align}
	C_4 &\equiv (p_\mathrm{miss}^x)^2, \label{eq:Cvec_modified} \\
	C_8 &\equiv (p_\mathrm{miss}^y)^2. \nonumber
\end{align}

The other issue is to make the numerical problem dimensionless. All elements of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{P}$ now have mass dimension 1, while all elements of $\mathbf{S}$, and thus $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{C}$, have dimension 2. We are free to multiply both sides of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:APS} by some normalization mass $M_\mathrm{norm}$ squared,
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{M_\mathrm{norm}^2} \mathbf{A}\mathbf{P} = \frac{1}{M_\mathrm{norm}^2} \mathbf{S},
\end{align}
and we choose to take it into the matrix and vectors such that they all become dimensionless, {\it i.e.}\ we modify
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{\hat A} = \frac{1}{M_\mathrm{norm}}\mathbf{A},\nonumber \\
	\mathbf{\hat P} = \frac{1}{M_\mathrm{norm}}\mathbf{P},\label{eq:vectors_normalized}\\
	\mathbf{\hat S} = \frac{1}{M_\mathrm{norm}^2}\mathbf{S},\nonumber 
\end{align}
thus modifying $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ in the same way as $\mathbf{S}$ to comply with Eq.\ \eqref{eq:SBMC}. We also modify the fitting function $\xi^2$ accordingly, so that it becomes
\begin{align}
	\xi^2(\mathbf{M}) = \sum_n \left[(\hat p_{A}^2)_n - \frac{M_A^2}{M_\mathrm{norm}^2}\right]^2 + \left[(\hat p_{A'}^2)_n - \frac{M_{A'}^2}{M_\mathrm{norm}^2}\right]^2.\label{eq:xisquared_modified}
\end{align}

To obtain numbers of order one, which is optimal for numerical purposes, we should pick a mass of the relevant scale for the problem. This is not something that is known {\it a priori}, since it depends on the supersymmetric masses that we are trying to determine. We might be tempted to use something based on the measured momenta, but this is a bad idea since it would mean weighting different events differently. We choose the normalization constant
\begin{align}
	M_\mathrm{norm} = 100 ~\mathrm{GeV},
\end{align}
the same order of magnitude as we expect for the supersymmetric masses (electroweak scale). 

We have made thorough checks that this formulation and the original one produce identical results within numerical accuracy, so that indeed the formulations are equivalent. The normed matrix and vectors $\mathbf{\hat A}$, $\mathbf{\hat P}$ and $\mathbf{\hat S}$ are the ones we will use throughout the rest of the thesis, and we will refer to them without the hats, {\it i.e.}\ $\mathbf A$, $\mathbf P$ and $\mathbf S$.

\section{Taking account of combinatorics}
\label{sec:combinatorics}
In a real detector event, the ordering of the quarks and leptons in and between chains is not known --- all we have are the measured particle types and their momenta. We must take this into account when applying the method to Monte Carlo simulated datasets. Webber does this by evaluating all possible combinations in each event at each mass point and selecting the combination which gives the lowest $\xi^2$ value, choosing to add this value to the sum in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:xisquared_modified}. The number of possible combinations are 8 or 16, depending on whether the lepton pairs in the two chains are the same flavour or not. 

For two pairs of different-generation leptons, the possible orderings are (given some `base ordering' which we permute from): Switching the ordering of the leptons in the first chain, switching the ordering of the leptons in the second chain, or switching the leptons in both chains.\footnote{We will in the following refer to the lepton which is nearest to the quark in the decay chain as the {\it near} lepton, and the other as the {\it far} lepton.} For each of these permutations we have the option to switch the two quarks, so the total number of combinations is 8. In the case of identical leptons, we may additionally interchange leptons between the chains --- but this only increases the total combinations by a factor of 2 because the same-chain leptons must have opposite charge.

Note that in order to switch the ordering of near and far leptons within the same chain, all we need to do is permute the rows of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$. The vector $\mathbf{C}$ is invariant as long as the same-chain leptons have the same mass. When the quarks are flipped, however, or when leptons are interchanged between chains, then we must redefine $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{C}$. Webber makes a point that this property can save computer memory, since one only has to store two or four versions of the matrix and vector for each event. We have not found this to be an issue.












\section{Outline of our plan}
\marginpar{Rewrite after chapters are in final form (check comments from Are when I do)}
In the following chapters we wish to investigate and develop this method further. We will begin by trying to reproduce Webber's parton level results using Monte Carlo simulations. We will then add layers of realism and complexety approaching something closer to the real experimental situation, in order to investigate its full potential. Along the way we will also make some improvements on the method.

The plan of attack is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We begin by generating squark pairs at rest, decaying them in the chain of on-shell two-body decays given in (\ref{eq:goldencascade}). The visible decay products, quarks and leptons, are then used to reconstruct the masses. As a benchmark we investigate the precision attainable for the CMSSM parameter point SPS1a~\cite{Allanach:2002nj}, which was used by Webber. 
	\item Because of final state radiation and parton showering, as well as --- to a lesser degree --- sparticle widths, the particles in the decay chain will not be on-shell due to extra gluons (and photons) in the final state. We employ a more sophisticated Monte Carlo code, {\tt Herwig++}~\cite{Bahr:2008pv}  to simulate these properties. This should have an effect on the mass reconstruction since Webber's method assumes on-shell decays.
	\item	We then compare results with and without including the combinatorical issues from identifying the decay products, and we add a simple parametrised momentum smearing, based on realistic detector response, in order to simulate that the measurement of the kinematics of final-state particles is not exact. This was the level of precision employed by Webber in~\cite{Webber:2009vm}.
	\item The partons that emerge from the hadron showers will hadronize, forming a hadron jet before arriving in the detector. Measurement of the initial parton from reconstructing such jets is one of the big challenges of collider physics. We use the {\tt FastJet}~\cite{Cacciari:2011ma} program for jet reconstruction, with algorithms used in the LHC experiments, and study the effect of jet reconstruction on the mass measurement.
	\item In an analysis of real data, one would have to use selection criteria such as cuts on transverse momentum and number of jets and leptons to discriminate between signal and background events. We will apply such cut schemes to our simulated events based on expectations for 14 TeV LHC. 
	% In addition we simulate the expected largest backgrounds for a four-lepton supersymmetry search and investigate how the performance of the method is affected by the presence of background.\marginpar{Remove mention of background?}
	% \item {\bf If time} As a last step towards realism, we put the events through a fast detector simulation. 
	% \item We then investigate improvements over the original model. Webber and collaborators \cite{Nojiri:2010dk} propose combining the kinematical best-fit reconstruction with measurements of end points of invariant mass distributions.
	% \item Investigating other types of chains. Not-equal-sided? Different number of steps? Fitting a mass plane rather than points?
	% \item Finally, we look at a well motivated model taken from \cite{Allanach:2014gsa} that was constructed on the basis of a small excess seen in 8 TeV data by the CMS Collaboration~\cite{CMS:2014jfa}, which would be consistent with the decay chain in (\ref{eq:goldencascade}). We show what precission we can expect from mass measurments at 14 TeV LHC should such a scenario be realized.

\chapter{Investigating Webber's method by Monte Carlo simulations}
\label{ch:MC}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Webber demonstrates the aptitude of the method on a Monte Carlo generated dataset. A natural starting point for our study is to try to reproduce his results, which is the main focus of the present chapter. 

\section{Reproducing Webber's results}
There are several ways in which a pair of squarks can be produced in $pp$ collisions. The three main categories are: direct pair production of two squarks or a squark-antisquark pair, squark plus gluino with subsequent gluino decay to a squark, and pair production of two gluinos which both subsequently decay to squarks. The mechanism of production affects how much momentum goes into the squark, and thus the momentum boost of the subsequent decay chain. However, the quantity which is reconstructed, $p_A^2$, is Lorentz invariant. Still, the numerical aspects of the reconstruction depend on the measured momenta. The three different categories also affect how many hard jets are present in the event, which affects the combinatorical aspects of reconstructing the chain. This problem we will return to in Chapter \ref{ch:investigating_improvements}.

In \cite{Webber:2009vm}, Webber studies the benchmark CMSSM parameter point SPS1a \cite{Allanach:2002nj} which we discussed in Section \ref{sec:sps1a_benchmark_point}. He uses {\tt HERWIG 6.510} \cite{Corcella:2000bw,Moretti:2002eu} to produce events, selecting only events with two left-handed first- or second generation squarks (to limit the mass splitting), but irrespective of the hard production process. He further specifies to only include events where the lepton pairs of the two chains are of different flavour, and require them both to be of first or second generation. He uses the quark four-momenta before parton showering, which means that the quarks potentially are off-shell, and takes the quark masses to be the invariant mass of these four-momenta.

The analysis, {\it i.e.} minimization of the $\xi^2$, is performed on 100 samples of 25 events each, using the {\tt Minuit} \cite{James:1975dr} {\tt Simplex}  routine for minimization. He models the effects of measurement errors in a real detector by applying a common momentum smearing on all particles according to a gaussian distribution, and he investigates a cut on the total $\xi^2$ obtained at the minimum to eliminate samples which give a bad result. His final results are summarized in Table 1 of \cite{Webber:2009vm}, which we for convenience show in Table \ref{table:webber_original}. The four columns labeled $m_i$ show the mean values and r.m.s.\ errors of each of the fitted masses in the samples, with the true masses shown in parenthesis. The column $\delta p/p$ indicates the standard deviation of the gaussian smearing applied on the momenta, $\xi^2_\mathrm{max}$ indicates the cut value on the $\xi^2$, $f_\xi$ is the fraction of samples surviving the cut and $f_\mathrm{corr}$ is the fraction of events where the chosen particle combination, selected as described in Section \ref{sec:combinatorics}, is the correct one. Note that if a sample is rejected by the $\xi^2$ cut, it means that this sample would have failed experiment, since each sample is a separate simulation of a run of the LHC.

\end{table}

To reproduce Webber's results, we have mainly generated events using {\tt Herwig++ 2.7.1} \cite{Bahr:2008pv}. As a control, and to enable us to interface the simulation with jet reconstruction software later, we have also used {\tt Pythia 8.2} \cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}. We have also had access to the {\tt HERWIG 6.510} code used in the original paper, enabling us to make a quite close reconstruction of Webber's analysis \cite{Webber:epost}. The reproductions of Webber's results in the present chapter are done with the {\tt HERWIG} code. In Section \ref{sec:without_combinatorics} we switch to a {\tt Herwig++} generated dataset, which we also use through most of Chapter \ref{ch:investigating_improvements}, before we employ {\tt Pythia} to study jet reconstruction effects in Section \ref{sec:jetrec}. Even though the SPS1a parameter point is excluded by experimental data, we choose to use it for our study to be able to compare as closely as possible to Webber's results.

To minimize the $\xi^2$ function, we have used the {\tt Simplex} algorithm. For the reproduction of Webber's results in the present chapter we have used the {\tt Minuit} implementation, which was also used in \cite{Webber:2009vm}. For the subsequent investigation of improvements, we have also used a custom implementation listed in Appendix \ref{ch:simplex}. In the course of our investigation, we have discovered that the mass fit is heavily dependent on the input parameters to the {\tt Simplex} minimization, and this makes the fit more challenging. To facilitate the subsequent discussion, we briefly introduce the {\tt Simplex} method.

\section{The Nelder-Mead {\tt Simplex} algorithm}
\label{sec:simplex_discussion}
{\tt Simplex} \cite{nelder1965simplex} is a heuristic minimization search method for minimizing a scalar function of $N$ variables. It takes a starting parameter point as input from the user. From this parameter point it erects a {\it simplex}, an $N+1$-dimensional generalization of a triangle, by slightly increasing each of the coordinates of the parameter point in turn.\footnote{The simplex can be constructed in various ways. Another option is to scale the coordinates by a factor, rather than adding a constant value. The behaviour of the minimization turns out to be very similar in this case.} It then begins to evaluate the function in the vertices of this simplex. A new simplex is constructed by reflecting the vertex with the highest function value around the (hyper)line made out of the other $N$ vertices. Hopefully this new simplex lies lower in the function terrain, and thus the algorithm iterates towards a local minimum. In case of trouble, it may also try contracting the simplex or distorting its shape in various ways to obtain points of lower function values. 

Since the method is heuristic, so is the convergence criterion. Convergence is said to be obtained when the {\it estimated distance to minimum (EDM)} is smaller than some set tolerance value. Usually there is also a predefined maximal number of iterations before the method gives up, to avoid going on forever on non-converging problems. The EDM is commonly defined as
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{EDM}(f_\mathrm{min},f_\mathrm{max}) = \frac{|f_\mathrm{max}-f_\mathrm{min}|}{|f_\mathrm{max}| + |f_\mathrm{min}|},
\end{align}
where $f_\mathrm{min}$ and $f_\mathrm{max}$ are the function values at the lowest and highest point of the current simplex, respectively. This means that the convergence criterion really measures how ``flat'' the simplex is, and thus how steep the function is in the region. If the tolerance is too high, then we run the risk of obtaining convergence in a region where the gradient is not steep enough to be resolved by the set tolerance, but which may still be far from the minimum.

A pitfall of any minimization routine, also for Minuit Simplex, is that it has a default tolerance value which is used automatically unless the user specifically changes it. The default tolerance in {\tt Minuit Simplex} is 0.1. This appears to be what Webber has used. We have confirmed that we obtain statistically consistent results when choosing that value. However, this does not always resolve our particular function well enough, because it tends to have almost flat directions in mass space for some sets of events.

	\label{fig:3D_masses}
\end{figure}
This is illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:3D_masses}, which shows contour plots of the $\xi^2$ for one sample of 25 events as a function of pairs of mass parameters. We see that in this sample, the $\tilde \chi_1^0$ direction is flat at low mass values, a feature which stretches down to $m_{\tilde \chi_1^0}=0~\mathrm{GeV}$. Note, however, that there may be additional higher-dimensional degeneracies in the four-mass space which will not show in a two-dimensional plot.

Setting the tolerance high may therefore lead to convergence at a non-minimal point. If, additionally, the search is started at or close to the masses used to generate the Monte Carlo, then the minimization may obtain ``convergence'' at points very close to the true value, but these points are not minimal points, just regions where the function is not very steep.

\section{The effect of tolerance}

  \label{fig:webber_scatter}
\end{figure}
Refer to the scatter plot in Fig.\ 2 of \cite{Webber:2009vm}, displayed in Fig.\ \ref{fig:webber_scatter} for convenience. It is a scatter plot of the best-fit mass points in the fit corresponding to the first row of Table \ref{table:webber_original}. We have reproduced this fit using Webber's code \cite{Webber:epost}, but we have generated our SPS1a parameter point using {\tt SOFTSUSY 3.4.1} \cite{Allanach:2001kg} rather than {\tt ISAJET 7.59}, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:sps1a_benchmark_point}. We have converted the resulting SLHA \cite{Skands:2003cj} model file to the {\tt ISAWIG} format readable by {\tt HERWIG 6.510} using the package {\tt PySLHA 3.0.2} \cite{Buckley:2013jua}.\footnote{We have had to make several modifications to the {\tt PySLHA} code to make the {\tt ISAWIG} output readable by {\tt HERWIG 6.510}. These changes have been included in {\tt PySLHA 3.0.3} by the author.} The effects of using a different RG-runner is that the SUSY masses are not exactly the same. The most significant shift is the squarks, which in Webber's case have a mass of 540 GeV, compared to 565 GeV in our case. We observe similar results as Webber gives in his article when we run his code with the original settings for our SUSY parameter point.

\end{table}

However, the tolerance setting in {\tt Minuit} can be adjusted. When we rerun the code used to produce Fig.\ \ref{fig:webber_rec_scatter_tolerance-comparison_a} with the tolerance set to $10^{-12}$,\footnote{This will be referred to as {\it low tolerance} below.} we get the fit shown in \ref{fig:webber_rec_scatter_tolerance-comparison_b} and listed in Table \ref{table:webber_rec_lowtol}. The results are not dramatically altered, but there are some features to notice: There is a clear tendency to a linear correlation between the masses. This is a feature we should expect physically from the kinematics: By co-varying all the masses, the fit does not change much. This can be seen in the matrix dependence on the masses.\footnote{This is part of the reason why these kinds of mass reconstruction methods very often reconstruct the squared mass {\it difference} rather than the masses themselves.} The fact that this physically reasonable degenerate direction appears when the tolerance is reduced indicates that a such a reduction is necessary to achieve reliable results. We also see that the fitted masses now seem slightly biased toward lower values. Finally, we note that while the mean value and errors are still consistent with the true values, their accuracy is somewhat reduced. Particularly so for the LSP, where the fit is reduced from $99 \pm 3$ GeV to $83 \pm 19$ GeV, compared to the true value of 97 GeV.

These fit results, with the low tolerance setting, are still not bad. However, in Table \ref{table:webber_original}, Webber also gives best-fit values where he has applied smearing to the four-momenta, as a crude approximation to the effects of limited detector resolution. He does this by smearing the spatial components according to a gaussian distribution of a given r.m.s.\ width $\delta p/p$, and then setting the energy component to the value which leaves the invariant mass of the four-vector unchanged.

	\label{fig:webber_rec_scatter_tolerance-comparison_5pmomsmear}
\end{figure} 
In Fig.\ \ref{fig:webber_rec_scatter_tolerance-comparison_5pmomsmear} we show scatter plots of the fits to the dataset smeared with $\delta p/p = 5\%$, minimized with original and reduced tolerance, again using Webber's code for event generation and minimization. The fit with original tolerance is consistent with Fig.\ 3 of \cite{Webber:2009vm}, as it should be. However, when the tolerance is reduced, the fit results are worsened considerably. Since each event is smeared individually, this appears to greatly affect the position of the minimum. Again we see that the LSP (yellow) recieves the roughest treatment, being pushed to much lower values than the true one in most cases. The results are even worse for the 10\% smeared dataset. 
%We also note that in the {\tt HERWIG} code Webber uses, initial-state radiation of photons in SUSY decays is switched off, which may contribute to making the measurement unrealistically good.\marginpar{Are doesn't think this is a big effect, but I am not sure. I did complete momentum conservation in my events same as Webber, in practice turning off ISR. Should consider checking, or rewriting.}

However, Webber also investigates the effects of imposing a {\it cut} on the $\xi^2$ value obtained at the minimum. In his fits, this cut tends to remove the bad events, giving a better fit. Applying a cut also helps for the reduced-tolerance fit, although it does not recover Webber's original low error estimate. In Table \ref{table:webber_rec_lowtol} we reproduce Table \ref{table:webber_softsusy} for the reduced-tolerance fit. We note that the fraction of samples passing the $\xi^2$ cut is drastically reduced compared to Table \ref{table:webber_softsusy}. The fraction of events where the best-fit combination is the true one is also reduced. The fact that the fraction of samples passing the $\xi^2$ cut decreases is puzzling --- one would expect that a lower tolerance ensures that the fit obtains a lower $\xi^2$ value. However, the form of the $\xi^2$ is very complicated due to the combinatorical ambiguities, and it may be difficult for {\tt Simplex} to handle.

\section{Starting point dependence of the best-fit point}
\label{sec:SP-dependence_webber}
There is also another potential issue with Webber's analysis. It has to do with the fact that the best-fit search is started at the true mass values.  In a real experiment, these parameters are the unknowns we wish to find. Starting the search here is in principle fine as long as we are sure that the algorithm always finds the true global minimum. So we must investigate what happens if we start our search in some other point. We have done this for a motivated set of starting points, and discover that this greatly affects the location of the best-fit points.

\end{figure}

In Fig.\ \ref{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics} we show the best-fit points for four low-tolerance minimizations on the unsmeared {\tt HERWIG 6.510} dataset. Figure \ref{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics_a} is the same as Fig.\ \ref{fig:webber_rec_scatter_tolerance-comparison_b}, the minimization started from the true mass point (TMP). The other three are minimizations from starting points selected to illustrate other plausible mass spectra: one where both the masses and the mass differences are smaller (b), one where they are larger (c), and one where there is a large splitting between a heavy squark and three very light masses (d). It is obvious that the results of the fit is hugely dependent on where we start the search. This concerns both the location of the best-fit point and the number of samples where convergence, as defined in Section \ref{sec:simplex_discussion}, is obtained within 500 iterations, indicated by the number $N_\mathrm{bins}$ in each plot. For instance, the mean value and standard errors of the squark masses for the samples range from $506 \pm 98~\mathrm{GeV}$ to $563 \pm 13~\mathrm{GeV}$. We also note that the margins of error in the latter case, which is minimization from the TMP, exclude the mean values obtained from the other three starting points.

It might, however, be that the function has multiple local minima, giving rise to the behaviour in Fig.\ \ref{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics}, but that the {\it global} minimum is the one we find by starting in the TMP. To investigate this, we have run minimizations (with low tolerance) where we perturb the starting point of each of the four parameters for each event sample away from the TMP by a gaussian distribution of width 10\% or 20\% of the TMP mass values. This is a minor perturbation relative to the masses. The minimization results are shown in Table \ref{table:webber_rec_lowtol_perturbedSP-percentage} for perturbations of 10\% (top) and 20\% (bottom). The standard errors of the fit increase considerably compared with Table \ref{table:webber_rec_lowtol}.

\section{Sans combinatorics}
\label{sec:without_combinatorics}
If we for a moment forget about the combinatorics, and evaluate only the true particle combination for each event, then the minimization gives consistent results irrespective of starting point.

	\label{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_no_combinatorics}
\end{figure}
This is illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_no_combinatorics}, which shows minimization of 100 samples of 25 events minimized with low tolerance, but only evaluated with the correct combination of chain particles.\footnote{This dataset is generated with {\tt Herwig++ 2.7.1} \cite{Bahr:2008pv} and minimized using our own implementation of the {\tt Simplex} algorithm in C++, included in Appendix \ref{ch:simplex}. 
% Only events where the momentum in the chain is exactly conserved --- {\it i.e.}\ no final-state radiation of photons is allowed --- are included.
We have checked that this dataset gives consistent results with the {\tt HERWIG 6.510} program used in Chapter \ref{ch:MC}. The reason we switch is that the {\tt HERWIG 6.510} code \cite{Webber:epost} does both Monte Carlo generation and {\tt Simplex} minimization together, without storing event data, while we want to be able to rerun the minimization without regenerating the Monte Carlo.} There are differences between the fits, mainly between Fig.\ \ref{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_no_combinatorics_d} and the others. In particular, while about 85 of the samples converge within the set limit of 500 iterations in each of the cases a, b and c (indicated by the value of $N_\mathrm{bins(total)}$ in the top right of each plot), this number is reduced to 67 in d. The starting point in case (d) is characterized by a much larger mass gap between the squark and the $\tilde\chi_2^0$ than in the TMP, which we might surmise would give rise to very different kinematics than we have in our events. We tentatively conclude that the combinatorics is the main culprit in making the method sensitive to the starting point.
% In any case, the minimization is not a heavy calculation (the whole minimization of 100 bins, including combinatorics, is done in fractions of a second on a single CPU core), so doing a scan like the one we made above over different starting points is not unrealistic.
% \marginpar{Is there any point in doing a minimization grid scan here, for the no-combinatorics case? Maybe better to wait until I have handled combinatorics.}

We also keep in mind the effects of momentum smearing, and check the no-combinatorics minimization on the 5\% smeared dataset for the same four starting points. The plots are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:moving_on-starting_point_sensitivity_no_combinatorics_5pmomsmear}. We find that it also in this case gives consistent results irrespective of starting point --- but the LSP mass is fitted to zero in 63 of 94 samples. It appears that when the data is smeared, the method loses its sensitivity to the LSP mass. Or equivalently, we could say that it loses its sensitivity to the absolute mass scale of the problem.

\label{ch:investigating_improvements}
With the potentially significant systematic uncertainties inherent in Webber's original method, from the choice of starting point and the tolerance of the minimization, we will now turn to investigate possible improvements.


\section{Fitting mass squared differences}
We saw in the previous chapter that, even without taking combinatorical ambiguities into account, the method is insensitive to the absolute mass scale of the decay in many of the samples when the momentum resolution is smeared. In a later article \cite{Nojiri:2010dk}, Webber {\it et al.}\ reformulate the method in terms of squared mass differences. We can borrow their idea and reformulate the problem as a mass-squared-difference fit. Such a fit may be combined with measurements of the dilepton invariant mass edge to find the LSP mass, using Eq.\ \eqref{eq:invariant_mass_endpoint}, which can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
	m^2_{\tilde\chi_1^0} = (m^2_{\tilde l} - m^2_{\tilde \chi_1^0})\left[\frac{m^2_{\tilde\chi_2^0} - m^2_{\tilde l}}{(m_{ll}^\mathrm{max})^2} - 1\right],
\end{align}
or in the more abstract notation of Fig.\ \ref{fig:decaytree},
\begin{align}
	M^2_A = (M^2_B - M^2_A)\left[\frac{M^2_C - M^2_B}{(m_{ab}^\mathrm{max})^2} - 1\right].\label{eq:MLSP_dilepton_edge}
\end{align}
Thus we see that the LSP mass can be found from knowing only the mass-squared differences plus the invariant mass edge. This formulation is inspired by \cite{Cheng:2009fw}.

Referring back to Chapter \ref{ch:introducing_the_method}, and the way the reconstruction was formulated in terms of matrices, the only modifications we have to make in order to reformulate the problem as a mass-squared-difference fit are the following: Define a vector $\mathbf{M}$ of mass-squared differences
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{M} = (M^2_1, M^2_2, M^2_3),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
	M^2_1 = M_D^2 - M_C^2,\quad  M^2_2 = M_C^2 - M_B^2, \quad M^2_3 = M_B^2 - M_A^2,
\end{align}
and observe that the vector $\mathbf{S}$ may still be written as
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{M} + \mathbf{C},
\end{align}
provided we let
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix}
					-1 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & -1 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & -1 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 \\
					-1 & 0 & 0  \\
					0 & -1 & 0  \\
					0 & 0 & -1  \\
					0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
Thus the reconstructed LSP momenta $\mathbf{P} = (p_A^x, p_A^y, p_A^z, E_A, p_{A'}^x, p_{A'}^y, p_{A'}^z, E_{A'})$ are still given as 
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{M} + \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{C},
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are modified and $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ are as before.

This means that we can reformulate our problem to fit $M^2_{1,2,3}$ instead. However, since we in this case do not fit the masses themselves, our $\xi^2$ function,
\begin{align}
	\xi^2(\mathbf{M}) = \sum_n \left[(\hat p_{A}^2)_n - \frac{M_A^2}{M_\mathrm{norm}^2}\right]^2 + \left[(\hat p_{A'}^2)_n - \frac{M_{A'}^2}{M_\mathrm{norm}^2}\right]^2,\label{eq:xisquared_modified_repeat}
\end{align} 
has an unknown variable $M_A$. We choose to use the dilepton mass edge constraint, Eq.\ \eqref{eq:MLSP_dilepton_edge}, to calculate the value of $M_A^2$ from the squared mass difference at each function evaluation. In terms of the mass-squared differences $M^2_{1,2,3}$, $M_A^2$ is given as
\begin{align}
	M_A^2 = M^2_3\left[ \frac{M^2_2}{(m_{ll}^\mathrm{max})^ 2} - 1 \right].
\end{align}
We note that with these modifications, we have introduced another constraining equation into our problem, thus reducing the number of free parameters from two to one, as discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:introducing_the_method}. In addition, the minimization problem has been reduced from a four-dimensional one to a three-dimensional one.

\end{figure}
A fit of the unsmeared dataset with this method, not considering combinatorics, is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:MD_nocomb-nosmear}. We have used the theoretical value of $m_{ll}^\mathrm{max} = 80.1~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the SPS1a masses, calculated using Eq.\ \eqref{eq:invariant_mass_endpoint}. The experimental uncertainty on $m_{ll}^\mathrm{max}$ is not expected to be significant compared to other sources of uncertainty. We have checked that the fit also in this case is independent of where we start the search. We also show the same fit on the dataset with 5\% momentum smearing in Fig.\ \ref{fig:MD_nocomb-5psmear}. In the last chapter we saw that with momentum smearing, the LSP mass was estimated to zero in 63 of of the 94 convergent samples, Fig.\ \ref{fig:moving_on-starting_point_sensitivity_no_combinatorics_5pmomsmear}, when we used the original formulation of the method. In this case all the samples obtain a nonzero LSP mass. For the remainder of the thesis we will use the mass-squared-difference (MSD) minimization.

\end{figure}

We also want to investigate whether the modifications have affected the combinatorical problems we faced when using the original formulation, where we pick the lowest value of $\xi^2$ among all combinations for each event in each point. We saw in Section \ref{sec:SP-dependence_webber} that the results were dependent on where the minimization search was started. 

In Fig.\ \ref{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics} we demonstrated the performance of the minimization of the unsmeared {\tt HERWIG 6.510} dataset using four different starting points for the {\tt Simplex} search. In Fig.\ \ref{fig:MD_starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics} we show the same plot using the MSD technique on the {\tt Herwig++} dataset, selecting between the different combinatorical choices by always choosing the lowest $\xi^2$ value. Although there are large biases and standard errors, the {\it differences} between the four scatter plots in Fig.\ \ref{fig:MD_starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics} appear less significant than in Fig.\ \ref{fig:starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics}. This is reflected in the mean values, which for {\it e.g.}\ the squark range from 507 to 519 GeV in the four plots, and in the standard errors, which all are about 60 GeV for the squark. There are similar consistencies between the plots for the other three masses. The four different starting points are also consistent with respect to how many samples obtain convergence in the minimization (about 50 of 100), and how many events obtain the correct combinatorical choice in the best-fit point (about 25\% of the convergent samples). 

Even though the four plots in Fig.\ \ref{fig:MD_starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics} are statistically similar, the individual event samples are not consistently fitted to the same points, and the same samples do not obtain convergence in all cases. 32 of the 100 event samples obtain convergence from all four starting points, although each starting point has about 50 convergent samples. Only three of the samples obtain best-fit points less than $0.1$ GeV apart in all four masses in all four cases.
% The standard error between the four best-fit points for each event sample has an average of between 10 and 15 GeV for the four masses.\marginpar{Does this sentence make sense? Also, do the same analysis for the case with xisquared-cut?}



\section{Summing the combinations}
\label{sec:combinatorics-sum_all_contributions}
We saw in Section \ref{sec:without_combinatorics} that when we minimize only the true combinatorical choice, the minimization is independent of starting point. If we include all combinations by always selecting the lowest among the $\xi^2$ values in each mass point, a starting point dependence is introduced. The mathematical difference between these two problems is that in the former case, the $\xi^2$ is a smooth polynomial, while in the latter case it is not. We can make the $\xi^2$ surface smooth if we add the different combinatorical choices together instead of jumping between them. Webber mentions this option in his article, but discards it, saying {\it ``[t]he surface would be smooth if one added the $\xi^2$ contributions of all combinations,  but then the sensitivity to the correct solution is reduced and biases are introduced by the huge contributions of wrong combinations''} \cite{Webber:2009vm}. 

However, not all combinations will contribute equally if they are included. Reference \cite{Gripaios:2011jm} features a general discussion on momentum reconstruction problems with missing energy, and also a specific discussion of the golden MSSM decay chain. Although they discuss other mass reconstruction methods than our present minimization scheme, some of the discussion applies to our case as well. They argue that the permutation of the leptons within the same chains introduces only a minor error into the reconstruction, which because of the kinematics should vanish in the limit of large $m_{\tilde q}-m_{\tilde \chi_1^0}$ mass gap.

For events where the dileptons differ in flavour between the chains, which is what we have used in our analysis thus far, there are eight combinatorical possibilities. These can be divided into two categories depending on which lepton pair is paired with which quark. For each of these pairings, there are four combinations of near and far leptons, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:combinatorics}. The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invariant, up to a permutation of rows, for each of the two categories. If we include all four combinations of near and far leptons for each event by adding them to the $\xi^2$, then the problem reduces from an eight-fold ambiguity to a two-fold ambiguity, distinguished only by the permutation of quarks between chains. 
\begin{figure}[hbt]

	\caption{Minimization of the unsmeared {\tt Herwig++} dataset where all orderings of the leptons within the same chains are included in the calculation of $\xi^2$, and only the true quark-lepton combinations are considered.}
	\label{fig:4combosum_nocomb-nosmear}
\end{figure}

In Fig.\ \ref{fig:4combosum_nocomb-nosmear} we show a fit of the unsmeared dataset where the $\xi^2$ has been constructed in this way, but where only the true pairing of quarks and leptons is considered. The mean values and standard errors for the mass fits in the 100 samples are $m_{\tilde q} = 565 \pm 41~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde \chi_2^0} 180 \pm 34~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde l} = 141 \pm 34~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $m_{\tilde \chi_1^0} = 98 \pm 35~\mathrm{GeV}$. The standard error is quite large, about 40 GeV for all the four masses, but the mean values are very close to the true values in all four cases. The minimization is also completely robust against starting points: For the four different starting points defined earlier, all 100 samples obtain convergence in all cases, and each sample is fitted to the same point in all cases. In the case where we jump between values, 50\% of the event samples obtain convergence, see Fig.\ \ref{fig:MD_starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics}. Since a real LHC analysis only will have one sample of events, the convergence robustness is an important factor.

% 	\label{fig:8combosum-nosmear}
% \end{figure}
% This is shown in fig.\ \ref{fig:8combosum-nosmear}. 
We have also tried including all eight combinations instead of only the four lepton permutations. Then the results worsen considerably. While the robustness against starting points is retained, only half of the samples obtain convergence, and the errors on the masses are about 90 GeV for the three lightest particles and 150 GeV for the squark. There is also a significant downward bias on the squark mass.

\subsection{Error introduced when summing lepton permutations}
% The method of summing the four closest combinations is investigated further. 

The lepton permutations consist of permuting the leptons in one, both or none of the two chains. Consider one decay chain, shown schematically in fig.\ \ref{fig:decaytree_improvementchap}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/fig-chain.pdf} % Stolen!
\caption{Decay topology, from \cite{Miller:2005zp}.}
\label{fig:decaytree_improvementchap}
\end{figure} 
For the true assignment of near and far lepton, we have the relationship $m^2_B = (p_A + p_a)^2 \equiv m^2_{Aa}$. If the lepton assigments are switched, it corresponds to reconstructing the mass $(p_A + p_b)^2 = m^2_{Ab} \equiv m_X$ instead of the true mass $M_B$. The kinematics of this misidentification is investigated in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_invmass-calculations}. It turns out that $m_X$ has a probablity distribution limited by the values 
\begin{align}
	{m_X^2}_\mathrm{high} &= m_A^2 + m_C^2 - m_B^2,\\
	{m_X^2}_\mathrm{low} &= \frac{m_C^2 m_A^2}{m_B^2}.\nonumber
\end{align}
Note that $m_X$ is contained in the interval $(m_A, m_C)$ for any kinematically allowed choice of masses $M_{A,B,C}.$ The probability distribution of $M_X$ is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mX-dist_improvementchap}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/appendix/mX-distribution.pdf}
\caption{Probability distribution of $m_X$.}
\label{fig:mX-dist_improvementchap}
\end{figure}
For SPS1a, the limits evaluate to ${m_X}_\mathrm{low} = 121~\mathrm{GeV}$ and ${m_X}_\mathrm{high} = 145 ~\mathrm{GeV}$. Thus, in this case, the high $m_X$ limit is close to the true $m_B = 144 ~\mathrm{GeV}$. This does not have to be the case generally. 

In principle the measurement of the other masses should be unaffected by this, {\it e.g.}\ since $m_C^2 = (p_b + p_a + p_A)^2$ which is invariant under $b\leftrightarrow a$. However, there is a nontrivial relationship between the fitted masses in the method, {\it e.g.}\ due to the dilepton edge formula, so the misidentification may affect them indirectly.

\section{Cutting on the determinant}
In this section we investigate what can be gained by applying a minimal value cut on the determinant of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$. The idea behind this is that since a matrix with zero determinant is uninvertible, the magnitude of the determinant may be small for events that are ``difficult'' to invert in some sense, and these may contribute poorly to the fit. 

This turns out to have some merit, as can be seen from Fig.\ \ref{fig:detAcut}: The plot (a) is exactly the same as in Fig.\ \ref{fig:4combosum_nocomb-nosmear}, except that the $\mathrm{det}\mathbf{A}$ cut has been applied on an event-wise basis. The errors on the masses decrease by a factor two. They are further reduced by combining with a $\xi^2$ cut, but at the expense of losing a lot of samples. About 60\% of events pass a $|\mathrm{det}\mathbf A|>10$ cut. The events passing the cut are as expected quite evenly distributed between samples, with the worst sample retaining 10 of 25 events after cuts and the best retaining 24. The distribution of the number of events in each sample passing the cut have a mean value of 15 with a standard deviation of 2.5. 

Note that while the $\xi^2$ cut used earlier will remove the whole sample, the $\mathrm{det}\mathbf A$ cut only removes parts of it, meaning that all the samples still may yield an answer, albeit possibly with low statistics.

There do not appear to be any jumps in $\mathrm{det}\mathbf{A}$ values which could be used to set the cut value.

\subsection{Sub-determinant cuts}
Consider again the full form of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, 
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{A} = \frac{2}{M_\mathrm{norm}} \begin{pmatrix}
						p_c^x & p_c^y & p_c^z & -E_c & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_b^x & p_b^y & p_b^z & -E_b & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_a^x & p_a^y & p_a^z & -E_a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						p_\mathrm{miss}^x/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_\mathrm{miss}^x/2 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{c'}^x & p_{c'}^y & p_{c'}^z & -E_{c'} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{b'}^x & p_{b'}^y & p_{b'}^z & -E_{b'} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_{a'}^x & p_{a'}^y & p_{a'}^z & -E_{a'} \\
						0 & p_\mathrm{miss}^y/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & p_\mathrm{miss}^y/2 & 0 & 0
					\end{pmatrix}. \label{eq:Amatrix_modified_subdetAcut}
\end{align}
It comes from the constraints in Eqs.\ \eqref{eq:constraints_projections1}--\eqref{eq:constraints_projections6}. These equations are projections of the unknown momenta $p_A / p_{A'}$ onto the measured momenta $p_{abc} / p_{a'b'c'}$. To be able to invert the equations and solve for $p_A / p_{A'}$, the three measured momenta for each chain must be linearly independent, {\it i.e.}\ they must form a basis for the subspace we are projecting $p_A/p_{A'}$ onto. Of course, three vectors cannot span a four-dimensional space --- this is the reason the problem is underconstrained and we have to find a best-fit solution, since there are not enough measured momenta to fully constrain the invisible ones. But we can look at the three-dimensional spatial momentum subspace. For {\it e.g.}\ $p_A$ to be reconstructible, we should have $\mathrm{span}\left\{ \mathbf p_a, \mathbf p_b, \mathbf p_c \right\} = \mathbb{R}^3$. This is equivalent to
\begin{align}
	\left| \mathbf p_a \cdot \left( \mathbf p_b \times \mathbf p_c \right) \right| \neq 0,\label{eq:vector_triple_product_parallellogram}
\end{align}
which is proportional to the sub-determinant of $\mathbf{A}$ given by
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{subdet}(\mathbf{A}, 1,3) = \frac{1}{M^3_\mathrm{norm}}\begin{vmatrix}p_c^x & p_c^y & p_c^z\\
	p_b^x & p_b^y & p_b^z\\
	p_a^x & p_a^y & p_a^z\end{vmatrix}.
\end{align}
If the value of the left hand side of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:vector_triple_product_parallellogram} is small, then the projections of the invisible momenta are numerically poor. Analogously to cutting on the full $\mathrm{det}\mathbf{A}$, we can apply a simultaneous cut on the values of the two subdeterminants
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{subdet}(\mathbf{A}, 1,3) &= \frac{1}{|\mathbf p_a||\mathbf p_b||\mathbf p_c|}
	\begin{vmatrix}p_c^x & p_c^y & p_c^z\\
	p_b^x & p_b^y & p_b^z\\
	p_a^x & p_a^y & p_a^z\end{vmatrix} = \frac{\left| \mathbf p_a \cdot \left( \mathbf p_b \times \mathbf p_c \right) \right| }{|\mathbf p_a||\mathbf p_b||\mathbf p_c|}, \\
	\mathrm{subdet}(\mathbf{A}, 5,7) &= \frac{1}{|\mathbf p_{a'}||\mathbf p_{b'}||\mathbf p_{c'}|}
	\begin{vmatrix}	p_{c'}^x & p_{c'}^y & p_{c'}^z\\
					p_{b'}^x & p_{b'}^y & p_{b'}^z\\
					p_{a'}^x & p_{a'}^y & p_{a'}^z\end{vmatrix} = \frac{\left| \mathbf p_{a'} \cdot \left( \mathbf p_{b'} \times \mathbf p_{c'} \right) \right| }{|\mathbf p_{a'}||\mathbf p_{b'}||\mathbf p_{c'}|},
\end{align}
where we have chosen a different normalization to make the subdeterminant values lie in the interval $[-1,1]$. The determinant with this normalization is what we will refer to as the subdeterminant in the following.

The distribution of the subdeterminant values for the unsmeared {\tt Herwig++} dataset is shown in figure \ref{fig:subdetA_distribution}. The subdeterminants corresponding to the two chains are included independently. It is interesting to note that the correlation coefficient between the determinant and subdeterminants is of the order $-0.01$, and a correlation hypothesis test shows consistency with the assumption that they are uncorrelated, at 95\% confidence level.

	\label{fig:subdetA_distribution}
\end{figure}

To test this approach, we apply cuts on the subdeterminants, by requiring that both subdeterminants are larger than some value, to the {\tt Herwig++} dataset. We use the cut values 0.03 and 0.005, chosen so that about 60\% and 90\% of the events pass the cut, respectively. 60\% is the same fraction as for the $\mathrm{det}\mathbf A$ cut used in Fig.\ \ref{fig:detAcut}, to enable comparison. We use the MSD fitting technique with a sum over the four lepton combinations, considering only the true $\mathbf A$ matrices, as in Fig.\ \ref{fig:detAcut}. The resulting scatter plot is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:subdetAcut}.

\end{figure}
% To have a sizeable fraction of events pass the $\xi^2$ cut, the cut value had to be set to 50000 in this case, compared to 1000 in fig.\ \ref{fig:detAcut}.
 We see that the errors on the masses in both cases are of the same order as in Fig.\ \ref{fig:4combosum_nocomb-nosmear}, where no determinant cut was applied, and thus they are a factor two larger than the errors in the case of the $\mathrm{det}\mathbf A$ cut in Fig.\ \ref{fig:detAcut_a}. Thus, the subdeterminant cut does not seem to make the fit better.


\section[Handling combinatorics in the summed-combination approach]{Handling combinatorics in the summed-\\combination approach}
\label{sec:handling_combinatorics_summed-combo}
We proceed with investigating the method of summing the four lepton combinations. In this formulation, the combinatorical ambiguity is reduced. When considering only events where the chains have opposite-flavour leptons (OFL), the ambiguity reduces from eight in the original formulation to two. For same-flavour leptons (SFL) it reduces from 16 to 4. Each of these combinations correspond to a different $\mathbf A$ matrix.

A complication is that, as mentioned in the beginning of Chapter \ref{ch:MC}, there may be more than two high-momentum quarks in an event. This is in fact quite likely, since one or both of the squarks in the chains may come from gluinos, originating from the processes $pp \to \tilde g \tilde q$ and $pp \to \tilde g \tilde g$ and decaying as $\tilde g \to \tilde q q$. In a realistic detector event, the quarks will fragment into hadron jets before reaching the detector. These jets must be reconstructed using specially constructed algorithms in order to determine, as well as possible, the four-momentum and invariant mass of the originating quark. This process potentially introduces large inaccuracies into the measurements of the four-momenta of the jets. 

Since we do not {\it a priori} know which jets belong to the event, the possibility of additional jets quickly increases the combinatorical ambiguity --- with three jets, there are six different $\mathbf{A}$ matrices for OFL events, and 12 for SFL events. With four jets, there are 12/24 different $\mathbf{A}$'s. It is clear that we need a way to handle the remaining ambiguity. 

There are several options for doing this. One is to utilize the original method of ``jumping'' between values, always selecting the lowest  among the combinations for each event at each mass point. When there are fewer different values to choose between, the amount of jumping and the resulting difficulties might be reduced. 

We check this for the unsmeared {\tt Herwig++} dataset with only OFL events, where there are only two combinations to jump between, by starting the minimization from the four different starting points. The resulting scatter plots are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:4combosum_starting_point_sensitivity_combinatorics-jumping}. We find in this case for the unsmeared dataset that $\sim 90$ samples converge in each case, while 84 of the samples converge in all four cases. 62 of the samples are fitted consistently, meaning that all four minimizations agree on all four mass values within 0.1 GeV. We also find that about 80\% of the events obtain the minimum with the correct combination, while the remaining 20\% apparently obtain smaller values using the wrong combination of quarks and leptons.

\subsection{An event-pair algorithm for handling combinatorics}
Another possibility is to combine a few events at a time, and minimize the $\xi^2$, with the lepton-combinations summed, separately for each of the quark-lepton combinations between chains, {\it i.e.}\ each matrix $\mathbf{A}$, in each event. For instance, if we select two events, then there are four ways to combine the quark-lepton assignments in the events: the right combination in both events, one right and one wrong, or both wrong. If the lowest $\xi^2$ minimum value among these four tend to belong to the right quark-lepton combination, then this may be used to select the correct quark-lepton combinations, and thus the correct $mathbf{A}$ for the event, before all events are summed together for the total mass fit. 

We have implemented this in the following way: We use the mass-squared difference fitting technique, and we sum the four leptonic combinations. For each sample of events, we run through all the individual events, indexing them by $i$. For each event, we run through all the other events, indexed by $j$. For each pair $(i,j)$,~we minimize the $\xi^2$ for the four possible combinations of $(\mathbf{A}_i^a, \mathbf{A}_j^b)$ matrices, where $a,b=1,2$ denotes the different $\mathbf{A}$ matrices for each event. We make a note of which choice $a$ for event $i$ gives the lowest minimum among the four. We allow the minima to take unphysical values for the fitted masses, either in the form of wrong mass hierarchies or even negative mass values, since we only are interested in the $\xi^2$ value. 

For each event $i$, we count how many of the $(i,j)$ pairs prefer the different choices of $\mathbf{A}_i^a$. If there is a clear preference for a specific choice $a$, then we select this as the ``true'' matrix. In the case of events where all four leptons are the same flavour, there will be four different $\mathbf{A}^a$ matrices instead of two, thus increasing the number of combinations to evaluate.

	\label{fig:correct_A_preference_distribution}
\end{figure}

For the unsmeared {\tt Herwig++} data set of 100 samples of 25 events, there seems to be a clear preference for the correct $\mathbf A$ matrix. The fraction of events where the correct $\mathbf A$ is chosen, for each event sample, is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:correct_A_preference_distribution}. We see that for the samples with the lowest fraction of correct events, the fraction is 60\%. Thus even the worst sample does better than a random guess, which has an expectance of 50\%. No cut on $\mathrm{det}\mathbf{A}$ is applied prior to the selection, since we find that we get a significantly clearer signal by including all events. We also apply a determinant cut to remove events after the selection. There is a slight shift towards a higher fraction of correct $\mathbf{A}$ after this cut. We obtain similar results for the dataset with 5\% momentum smearing.

Figure \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum} shows scatter plots of the best-fit points found by selecting $\mathbf{A}$ for each event according to this algorithm, and summing the remaining four combinations. Figure \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum_a} has no cut on the determinant, while a $|\mathrm{det}\mathbf A|>10$ cut is applied in Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum_b}.\footnote{The number $f_{\mathrm{det}\mathbf A} = 96\,\%$ in the plot in Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum_a} seems to indicate that not all events have passed the determinant cut, even though no cut has been applied. This is an artifact due to not all events passing the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix selection algorithm.}

\subsection{Including same-flavour lepton events}
In our analysis so far, we have discarded events where all the four leptons are of the same flavour (SFL events). This was done to limit the combinatorical ambiguity, but comes at the expense of halving the amount of events we can expect. In the language of our method, the inclusion of SFL events amounts to including two additional matrices $\mathbf{A}$ which come from permuting the leptons across the chains. It is interesting to see how the algorithm for choosing $\mathbf{A}$ tackles this case. We find that it handles it quite well. Figure \ref{fig:correct_A_preference_distribution_OSFL_a} shows the fraction of correctly identified $\mathbf{A}$ matrices with and without a determinant cut, on the unsmeared {\tt Herwig++} dataset with SFL events included. We see that almost all event samples obtain a fraction larger than 50\%, which should be compared to the expectance of random chance which is 25\% in this case. The SFL events are distributed as they come from the Monte Carlo, which means they constitute about half the events in each sample.
\begin{figure}[hbt]

\end{figure}

In Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum-OSFL}, we show the best-fit points obtained in this case. The errors are somewhat larger than when using only opposite-flavour leptons (OFL), and the downward bias is enhanced. The best-fit points with a determinant cut are $m_{\tilde q} = 547 \pm 31~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde \chi_2^0}=165 \pm 25~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde l} = 126 \pm 25~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $m_{\tilde\chi_1^0} = 83 \pm 25~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the OFL only case (Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum_b}), and $m_{\tilde q} = 534 \pm 35~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde \chi_2^0}=160 \pm 27~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde l} = 121 \pm 27~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $m_{\tilde\chi_1^0} = 78 \pm 28~\mathrm{GeV}$ when SFL events are included as well (Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum-OSFL_b}).

Since using only OFL events amounts to discarding half the available events, when SFL events are included we should really double the sample size. Figure \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum-OSFL-50events} shows scatter plots of this. The mean best-fit points with a determinant cut of 10 are $m_{\tilde q} = 539 \pm 32~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde \chi_2^0}= 165 \pm 19~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde l} = 125 \pm 19~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $m_{\tilde\chi_1^0} = 83 \pm 20~\mathrm{GeV}$. The errors are somewhat reduced compared to the minimization with 25-event samples, and they are also slightly lower than the 25-event sample minimization with only OFL events, though there is a larger downward bias on the squark mass than in the only-OFL case.

\subsection{Handling the remaining combinatorical ambiguity}
The method of event-pair selection described in the previous section provides a way to select between the quark-lepton combinations. With this, we in principle have a working method which can be applied to a sample of events without knowing the true combinatorical configuration, and which is robust against starting points and convergence issues. The plot of minimization on the unsmeared {\tt Herwig++} dataset with a determinant cut, shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum_b}, can be viewed as a best-case scenario for this technique. The mean best-fit values are $m_{\tilde q} = 547 \pm 31 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde \chi_2^0} = 165\pm 25 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde l} = 126 \pm 25 ~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $m_{\tilde \chi_1^0} = 83 \pm 25 ~\mathrm{GeV}$. Although the determinant cut has reduced the errors compared to Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum_a}, the errors are still very large --- as large as 30\% for the LSP. There is also a significant downward bias, which is enhanced by the determiant cut. Part of this uncertainty is introduced by the summing of the four leptonic combinations. It would be desirable to find a way to discriminate between these combinations also. 

One might try to revert to the method of ``jumping'' between combinations in the $\xi^2$ function, but jumping between only the four remaining combinations instead of all eight. We have tried this option, but it gives a very poor fit. 
% \marginpar{Should try detA cut to remove events before jump-minimizing. Maybe maybe maybe this helps. Implement as third option besides combosum and no combinatorics?} 

Another possibility is to do something analogous to the algorithm we applied to choose between the quark assignments. One could imagine pairing events and minimizing all combinations ($4^2 = 16$, in this case), selecting the combination which is minimal in most cases. However, this would only give two contributing terms to the $\xi^2$ for each minimization, instead of eight terms in the case where four permutations are summed. The $\xi^2$ turns out to be difficult to minimize in this case, and it often does not converge at all.

\section{Comparison benchmark}
We are now in a position to produce a table analogous to those of Chapter \ref{ch:MC}, for our modified implementation of the method. We apply the MSD fit with dilepton edge to the {\tt Herwig++} dataset with only OFL events. We use the event-pair selection algorithm to choose between the two $\mathbf{A}$ matrices for each event, and sum the remaining four lepton permutations in the $\xi^2$. We apply a minimal value determinant cut of 10. We also test applying a $\xi^2$ cut as in Chapter \ref{ch:MC}, although the cut value has to be set higher to get a sizeable fraction of samples past the cut because of the changes made to the method. We have chosen a cut value which gives a similar pass-cut fraction as in Webber's original analysis, Table \ref{table:webber_original}. The results are summarized in Table \ref{table:MD_fit_table}.\marginpar{Should I also make a table for 50-event samples including SFL events?}

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{MSD minimization on the {\tt Herwig++} dataset with and without momentum smearing and $\xi^2$ cuts. See the text for details.}
	\label{table:MD_fit_table}
\end{table}

We see that the $\xi^2$ helps to reduce the errors as before. Note that the fraction of events passing the $\xi^2$ cut does not decrease as rapidly with increased momentum smearing as in the original analysis of Webber. Particularily, we have not doubled the $\xi^2$ cut value for the 10\% smearing case, contrary to the original analysis. The mass errors from the fits in Table \ref{table:MD_fit_table} are larger compared to those of the original analysis \cite{Webber:2009vm}, given in Table \ref{table:webber_original}. For example, the 5\% smeared fit with $\xi^2$ cut has about twice as large error on the squark mass, while the errors on the other three masses are an order of magnitude larger. By reducing the $\xi^2$ cut value to 2000, we bring $f_{\mathrm{corr}}$ down to $56\%$, the same as in Table \ref{table:webber_original}. This brings the errors somewhat down, to give the best-fit values $m_{\tilde q} = 548\pm19~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde \chi_2^0}=163\pm16~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde l} = 124\pm16~\mathrm{GeV}$, $m_{\tilde \chi_1^0} = 81\pm16~\mathrm{GeV}$.

Note that this analysis is done with a determinant cut of 10. In a future analysis one could experiment with different combinations of determinant and $\xi^2$ cuts to find an optimal combination.

\section{Taking jet reconstruction effects into account}
\label{sec:jetrec}
Finally, we take the effects of jet reconstruction into account. We have simulated jet reconstruction using {\tt Pythia 8.2} \cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} with the {\tt FastJet} \cite{Cacciari:2011ma} jet reconstruction program. It utilizes the anti-$k_t$ jet clustering algorithm \cite{Cacciari:2008gp}, which does sequential jet recombination in the following way:

One defines a minimal transverse momentum $p_T$ that a jet can have, and an angular radius squared $R^2 = \Delta \eta^2 + \Delta \phi^2$ in the pseudorapidity--azimuthal angle $(\eta,\phi)$ plane of the detector. This radius defines the maximal angular size that a jet is allowed to have.

For an object $i$ with transverse momentum $k_{t,i}$, the distance between $i$ and the beam axis $B$ is defined as
\begin{align}
  d_{iB} = k_{t,i}^{-2},
\end{align}
and the distance between two objects $i$ and $j$ is defined as
\begin{align}
  d_{ij} = \mathrm{min} \left\{ k_{t,i}^{-2}, k_{t,j}^{-2} \right\}\frac{\Delta R_{ij}^2}{R^2},
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
  \Delta R_{ij}^2 = (\eta_i - \eta_j)^2 + (\phi_i - \phi_j)^2,
\end{align}
with $(\eta_i, \phi_i)$ the angular coordinates of $i$.

The transverse momenta $k_t$ of all particles in the detector are indexed by $i$. Then the algorithm does a sequential recombination by looping over all particles as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For a particle $i$, find the smallest value among all $d_{ij}$ and $d_{iB}$.
  \item If one of the $d_{ij}$ is smallest, then recombine the objects $i$ and $j$ by combining their four-momenta.
  \item If $d_{iB}$ is smallest, set $i$ to be a jet and remove it from the list of particles.
  \item Repeat from 1.\ until there are no particles left.
  \item All reconstructed jets which have a $p_T$ larger than the set threshold are kept.
\end{enumerate}

We use $R = 0.4$, $|\eta|<4$ as parameters for the jet reconstruction. We adapt the cuts used in \cite{Cheng:2009fw}, which are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item There must be at least two jets with $p_T > 100~\mathrm{GeV}$, $|\eta|<2.5$.
	\item All the four leptons must have $p_T > 10~\mathrm{GeV}$, $|\eta|<2.5$.
	\item The event must have missing $p_T > 50~\mathrm{GeV}$.
\end{enumerate}
Since we use {\tt Pythia} rather than {\tt Herwig++} for the jet reconstruction, we have checked that the events are consistent with previous results when jet reconstruction is not taken into account. 
% This is indeed the case, and fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_pythia_4combosum-OSFL-25events} shows analogous fits as fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_4combosum-OSFL} for the {\tt Pythia} dataset, {\it i.e.}\ MSD minimization on 25-event samples including both OF and SF lepton event, with a determinant cut applied in subfig.\ b.\marginpar{Quantify how similar they are?}

In Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_pythia_4combosum-jetrec-OFL-25events}, we show scatter plots of the best-fit points obtained for the {\tt Pythia} dataset with jet reconstruction, minimized on samples of 25 events with only opposite-flavour leptons. We take the quark masses to be the invariant masses of the reconstructed jets. We use the MSD minimization with a sum of lepton permutations and the event-pair selection algorithm for the quark-lepton permutation. As usual a $|\mathrm{det}\mathbf A|>10$ cut is applied in Fig.\ \ref{fig:event-pair-A-selection_pythia_4combosum-jetrec-OFL-25events_b}. The two hardest jets in each event have been taken as the signal jets. This is justified in SPS1a because of the small mass splitting between the gluino and the squarks, which limit the momentum attainable for the quarks from gluino decay in events containing $\tilde g \to q\tilde q$.

Another reason for selecting jets in this way is that the alternative would require discrimination between three or more jets. This quickly increases the combinatorical ambiguity, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:handling_combinatorics_summed-combo}. One could hope to reduce the ambiguity with additional selection criteria, such as constraints from the invariant mass edges discussed in the beginning of Chapter \ref{ch:introducing_the_method}, but the prospects for selecting the correct combination are still dim.

Note that when we use the jet reconstructed quark momenta, we lose information on which quark belongs to which chain in the Monte Carlo data. We thus no longer have the possibility to minimize only the correct quark-lepton combinations as a control, unless we match the jets to the quarks, which is a non-trivial procedure. 

Also, since the numbering of jets is independent from the numbering of chains, we should expect the $\mathbf{A}$ selection algorithm to have equal preference for the two matrices which have correct lepton combinations. Therefore, the fraction of events where the first $\mathbf A$ is selected should be centered on 0.5. The distribution of this fraction, with a $|\mathrm{det}\mathbf A|>10$ cut, is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:histogram_jetrec_A1preference} for 25-event samples of only OFL events and 50-event samples of both OFL and SFL events (abbreviated OSFL). We see that the distributions are centered close to 0.5 as we expect. The OSFL distribution has a slight preference for lower fractions, as we should expect since it chooses between four $\mathbf A$ matrices rather than two.\footnote{The two extra matrices are never the right ones, since they correspond to wrong lepton permutations between chains.}

The best-fit values are summarized in Table \ref{table:table_jetrec}. We have also tried applying cuts to the $\xi^2$ values in the minimization with determinant cuts. We have found $\xi^2$ cut values for each of the OFL and OSFL cases which yield about 15\%, 40\% and 75\% of samples past, respectively. We see that the two lowest $\xi^2$ cuts approximately halve the errors for both the OFL and the OSFL cases, while the loosest cut gives less of an error reduction. The OF and O\&SFL cases obtain similar results --- the OSFL case has somewhat smaller errors, but a larger downward bias.

The method presented by Webber, although promising, has been shown to have inherent technical problems which lead to under-estimation of the errors and biases in the original article \cite{Webber:2009vm}, given in Table \ref{table:webber_original}. The challenges stem in part from the combinatorical ambiguity inherent in the chain. 

When the estimates are revised, taking into account the need for a lower {\tt Simplex} tolerance in order to resolve the function minimum, the error is significantly increased, and biases are introduced, as can be seen from Table \ref{table:webber_rec_lowtol}. In addition, there is a dependence upon the minimization starting point which adds to the uncertainties, demonstrated in Table \ref{table:webber_rec_lowtol_perturbedSP-percentage}. Of particular importance is the feature that when experimental uncertainties are simulated in the form of momentum smearing, and the convergence tolerance is set sufficiently low, the mass of the LSP is fitted to zero in many of the samples (Fig.\ \ref{fig:moving_on-starting_point_sensitivity_no_combinatorics_5pmomsmear}). This is the case even without taking into account combinatorics.

Attempts to modify the method to avoid these problems only has limited success. Although we have devised an implementation that is robust against different starting points for the minimization algorithm, handles the combinatorical ambiguities and resolves the LSP mass, we have not found a way to reduce the errors to values that are comparable to the results pertained in the original article. Table \ref{table:MD_fit_table} gives a summary of the capabilities of the alternative implementation of the method, and should be compared to the original estimates given in Table \ref{table:webber_original}. For the three lightest particles, the errors in our analysis are an order of magnitude larger than the original estimate. We also observe a significant downward bias on all four masses.

Jet reconstruction effects were not investigated by Webber in the original article. Taking these into account should be expected to affect the precision attainable by the method, and we indeed find that it drastically increases the errors. Our results with jet reconstruction are summarized in Table \ref{table:table_jetrec}. When we apply a cut on the $\xi^2$ values which remove about half the event samples, along with a minimal value cut on the determinant, we obtain errors of the order 50 GeV on all four masses. For the LSP mass this corresponds to an error of 50\%. Doubling the event samples by including events where all four leptons have the same flavour reduces the errors somewhat, but at the expense of introducing a larger downward bias. 

In summary, we do not believe this method to be useful for precision measurements of sparticle masses. It may be used to set limits, but the limits will be rather wide. In addition, our analysis employs event samples which are large compared to the expected event yield given current limits on sparticle masses. Reducing the sample size is expected to further increase the uncertainties.

\chapter{The Dirac equation}
\label{appendix:diraceq}
% The Dirac equation is derived. The derivation closely follows \cite[pp.\ 225-229]{griffiths:elementary_particles}. 

Einstein's fundamental relationship between energy, momentum and mass in special relativity is
\begin{align}
  p^\mu p_\mu - m^2 = 0.\label{eq:energymomentum}
\end{align}
Following the prescriptions of quantum mechanics, energy and momentum are promoted to operators:
\begin{align}
	p_\mu \to i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} \equiv i\hbar \partial_\mu.
\end{align}
Taken as an eigenvalue equation for a field $\psi$, this gives rise to the relativistic {\it Klein-Gordon} equation
\begin{align}
	-\hbar^2 \partial^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - m^2 \psi = 0.
\end{align}
This equation differs from the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in that it is second order in $\partial_{0} = \partial_t$, while the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is first order. To obtain a first-order differential equation in time, Dirac attempted \cite{griffiths:elementary_particles} to factor the energy-momentum relation \eqref{eq:energymomentum} as
\begin{align}
	p^\mu p_\mu - m^2 = \left(\gamma^\kappa p_\kappa + m\right)\left(\gamma^\lambda p_\lambda - m\right).
\end{align}
This leads to the requirement
\begin{align}
	p^\mu p_\mu = \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu p_\mu p_\nu.
\end{align}
The right hand side can be written as
\begin{align}
	\gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu p_\mu p_\nu &= \frac{1}{2}\left( \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu p_\mu p_\nu + \gamma^\nu \gamma^\mu p_\nu p_\mu \right)\\
	&= \frac{1}{2}\left( \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu  + \gamma^\nu \gamma^\mu \right) p_\mu p_\nu,
\end{align}
where we have used the fact that $\mu$ and $\nu$ are dummy summation variables. This implies that
\begin{align}
	\left\{ \gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu \right\} = 2g^{\mu\nu},
\end{align}
where $g^{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric tensor, and the curly brackets denote the anticommutator $\left\{ \gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu \right\} = \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu + \gamma^\nu \gamma^\mu$. Dirac realized that this condition can be met provided we let the $\gamma^\mu$ be {\it matrices}. It turns out that the lowest possible dimension of these matrices is $4\times 4$. They may be represented in several equivalent bases, but one standard convention is
\begin{align}
	\gamma^0 = \begin{pmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1
	\end{pmatrix}, \quad{} \gamma^i = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 & \sigma^i \\ -\sigma^i & 0
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
where $\sigma^i$ are the Pauli matrices, $1$ denotes the $2\times 2$ identity matrix and $0$ the $2\times 2$ matrix of zeroes. With this factorization, the relativistic momentum-energy relation is satisfied by
\begin{align}
	\gamma^\mu p_\mu - m = 0.
\end{align}
The Dirac equation is obtained by substituting operators and letting them act on an object $\Psi$, giving
\begin{align}
	\left(i\hbar \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m\right)\Psi = 0,
\end{align}
where $\Psi$ is required by dimensionality to be a four-column vector of fields,
\begin{align}
	\Psi = \begin{pmatrix}
		\psi_1(x) \\ \psi_2(x) \\ \psi_3(x) \\ \psi_4(x)
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
called a Dirac {\it spinor}.

The {\it equations of motion} are the equations describing the field configurations which minimizes the {\it action},
\begin{align}
	S = \int d^4 x \, \mathcal{L},
\end{align}
Demanding stationarity of action for a spinor field $\Psi$ and its adjoint $\bar\Psi \equiv  \Psi^\dag \gamma^0$,
\begin{align}
	\delta S = 0,
\end{align}
gives the {\it Euler-Lagrange} equations of motion
\begin{align}
	\partial_{\mu}\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_{\mu}\Psi\right)}\right) - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\Psi} &= 0,\\
	\partial_{\mu}\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_{\mu}\bar\Psi\right)}\right) - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bar\Psi} &= 0.
\end{align}
The Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_D$ which yields the Dirac equation upon application of the equations of motion is
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_D = \bar \Psi \left( i\hbar \slashed \partial - m \right)\Psi,
\end{align}
called the Dirac bilinear.




\chapter{Higgs mass loop corrections}
\label{appendix:higgs_mass_loop_correction}
This appendix contains calculations of the one-loop contributions to the Higgs mass from fermionic and scalar particles.

\section{Fermion loop}
The diagram is given in Fig.\ \ref{fig:appendix_higgs_top_loop}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/appendix/higgs_top_loop_with_momenta.eps}
\caption{Fermionic loop correction to the Higgs mass.}
\label{fig:appendix_higgs_top_loop}
\end{figure}
The vertex factors are $-i\frac{y}{\sqrt{2}}$, where $y$ is the Yukawa coupling of the fermion, which has mass $m$. The amplitude is then given by
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal{M} =& -(-i)^2\frac{y^2}{2} \mathrm{Tr}\left\{ \int \frac{d^4 k}{(2\pi)^4} \frac{\left[ \slashed q + \slashed k + m \right]\left[ \slashed k + m \right]}{\left[(q+k)^2 - m^2 \right] \left[ k^2 - m^2 \right]}  \right\}.
\end{align}
The denominators can be combined by a Feynman parametrization,
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{\left[(q+k)^2 - m^2 \right] \left[ k^2 - m^2 \right]} &= \int_0^1 dx\, \frac{1}{\left[\left( (q+k)^2 - m^2\right) x + \left(k^2 -m^2 \right)(1-x)\right]^2}\nonumber \\
	&= \int_0^1 dx \, \frac{1}{\left[(k+qx)^2 - \Delta\right]^2},
\end{align}
where $\Delta \equiv q^2x(x-1)+m^2$. Defining $\ell \equiv k+qx$, we get
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal{M} &= -\frac{y^2}{2}\int_0^1 dx \int \frac{d^4\ell}{(2\pi)^4} \mathrm{Tr}\left\{ \frac{ \slashed{\ell}^2 + \slashed{q}^2x(x-1) + m^2}{\left[ \ell^2 - \Delta \right]^2}  \right\},
\end{align}
where we have omitted terms linear in $\ell$, since they vanish by the antisymmetry of the integral, and terms with an odd number of $\gamma$ matrices since they trace to zero. The remaining trace is found by using that
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Tr} \left\{ \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu\right\} = 4g^{\mu\nu},
\end{align}
and remembering that there is really also a $4\times 4$ identity matrix in the $m^2$ term. We then get
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal{M} &= -\frac{y^2}{2}\int_0^1 dx \int \frac{d^4\ell}{(2\pi)^4} 4 \frac{ {\ell}^2 + {q}^2x(x-1) + m^2}{\left[ \ell^2 - \Delta \right]^2}  \\
				&= -2y^2\int_0^1 dx \int \frac{d^4\ell}{(2\pi)^4} 4 \frac{ {\ell}^2 + \Delta}{\left[ \ell^2 - \Delta \right]^2}.\nonumber
\end{align}
We now make a Wick rotation by introducing the Euclidian variable $\ell_E$, given by $\ell^0 = i\ell^0_E$, $\vec\ell = \vec\ell_E$, such that
\begin{align}
	\ell^2 = -\ell_E^2, \quad d^4\ell = id^4\ell_E.
\end{align}
This gives
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal{M} &= i8y^2\int_0^1 dx \int \frac{d^4\ell_E}{(2\pi)^4}  \frac{ {\ell_E}^2 - \Delta}{\left[ \ell_E^2 + \Delta \right]^2}, 
\end{align}
which can be evaluated in spherical coordinates,
\begin{align}
	\int d^4\ell_E = \int d\Omega_4 \int d|\ell_E| \, |\ell_E|^3,
\end{align}
where $\Omega_4$ is the four-dimensional solid angle, which by spherical symmetry just gives
\begin{align}
	 \int d\Omega_4 = 2\pi^2.
\end{align}
By using a cutoff regularization parametrized by $\Lambda$, the whole amplitude is then
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal{M} = &-i\frac{4\pi^2}{(2\pi)^4}y^2 \int_0^1 dx\, \left[ \int_0^\Lambda d|\ell_E| \frac{|\ell_E|^5}{\left(|\ell_E|^2 + \Delta\right)^2} - \Delta \int_0^\Lambda \frac{|\ell_E|^3}{\left( |\ell_E|^2 + \Delta \right)^2}\right]\nonumber \\
	= &-iy^2\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_0^1 dx \, \left[ \frac{-2\Delta^2 + \Delta \Lambda^2 + \Lambda^4 - 3\Delta\left( \Delta + \Lambda^2\right)\log \left(\Delta + \Lambda^2\right)}{2\left(\Delta + \Lambda^2\right)} \right.\nonumber \\
	&-\left. \frac{-2\Delta^2 - 4\Delta^2\log\Delta}{2\Delta}\right]\\
	\overset{\Lambda^2 \gg \Delta}{\to} &-iy^2\frac{1}{4\pi^2} \frac{\Lambda^4}{2\Lambda^2}\nonumber \\
	= &-i\frac{y^2}{8\pi^2}\Lambda^2.\nonumber
\end{align}
For $y = |\lambda_f|$, this gives the first term in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:higgs_mass_corrections}.

\section{Scalar loop}
The diagram is given in Fig.\ \ref{fig:appendix_higgs_stop_loop}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/appendix/higgs_stop_loop_with_momenta.eps}
\caption{Scalar loop correction to the Higgs mass.}
\label{fig:appendix_higgs_stop_loop}
\end{figure}
The vertex factor is taken to be $i\lambda$, and $m$ is the mass of the scalar in the loop. The amplitude is given by
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal{M} &= i\lambda \int \frac{d^4k}{(2\pi)^4}\, \frac{i}{k^2-m^2}.
\end{align}
By Wick rotating $k\to k_E$ and switching to spherical coordinates as in the previous section, we get
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal{M}= &i\lambda \frac{1}{(2\pi)^4}\int d\Omega_4 \int_0^\Lambda d|k_E| \, \frac{|k_E|^3}{|k_E|^2 + m^2}\nonumber\\
				= &i\frac{\lambda}{16\pi^2} \left(\Lambda^2 + m^2\log \left( \frac{m^2}{m^2+\Lambda^2} \right) \right)\label{eq:scalar_loop_result}\\
				\overset{\Lambda^2 \gg m^2}{\to} &i\frac{\lambda}{16\pi^2} \Lambda^2.\nonumber
\end{align}
For $\lambda = \lambda_{\tilde f}$, this is the second term in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:higgs_mass_corrections}. 

Note that when the leading, quadratic terms cancel each other, the remainder in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:scalar_loop_result} is 
\begin{align}
	m^2\log \left( \frac{m^2}{\Lambda^2} \right),
\end{align}
which does {\it not} cancel with the fermion loop, since it depends on the scalar mass. If the scalar, {\it i.e.}\ the superpartner particle, is heavy, then this contribution may be significant. This puts restrictions on the sfermion masses in order not to reintroduce the fine-tuning, and is sometimes called the {\it little hierarchy problem}.

\chapter{Invariant mass with lepton misidentification}
\label{sec:appendix_invmass-calculations}
The invariant mass of particle $a$ and $A$ in the decay topology of Fig.\ \ref{fig:decaytree_appendix} is given by $m_{aA}^2 = (p_a + p_A)^2 = m_B^2$. However, if the particle $b$ is misidentified as $a$, what is the resulting invariant mass $m_X^2$? The calculation is most easily done in the rest frame of $B$. 
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/fig-chain.pdf} % Stolen!
\caption{Decay topology, from \cite{Miller:2005zp}.}
\label{fig:decaytree_appendix}
\end{figure}Let $p_a = (E_a, \mathbf p_a), p_A = (E_A, \mathbf p_A)$ in this frame. We assume $m_b = m_a = 0$. The decay must go back-to-back, so $\mathbf p_A = -\mathbf p_a$. Then, the condition
\begin{align}
	m_B^2 &= (p_A + p_a)^2 = p_A^2 + 2p_A \cdot p_a + p_a^2\\
	 		&= m_A^2 + 2\left( m_A^2 + |\mathbf p_a|^2 \right)^{1/2} |\mathbf p_a| + 2|\mathbf p_a|^2,
\end{align}
gives
\begin{align}
	|\mathbf{p}_a| = |\mathbf{p}_A| = \frac{m_B^2 - m_A^2}{2m_B}.
\end{align}
Thus, if $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ is a unit vector in the direction of $A$ in the rest frame of $B$, we have
\begin{align}
	p_A &= \left( \sqrt{ m_A^2 + \frac{(m_B^2-m_A^2)^2}{4m_B^2} },  \frac{m_B^2-m_A^2}{2m_B}\hat{\mathbf{p}} \right) = \left( \frac{m_B^2+m_A^2}{2m_B},  \frac{m_B^2-m_A^2}{2m_B} \hat{\mathbf{p}} \right),\\
	p_a &= \left( \frac{m_B^2-m_A^2}{2m_B},  -\frac{m_B^2-m_A^2}{2m_B}\hat{\mathbf{p}} \right). \nonumber
\end{align}
% In the reference frame of $C$, the same reasoning gives for the four-momenta $p_B'$ and $p_b'$\footnote{$\hat{\mathbf{p}}'$ is generally {\it not} the Lorentz transformation of $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$.}
% \begin{align}
% 	p_B' &= \left( \frac{m_C^2+m_B^2}{2m_C^2}, \frac{m_C^2-m_B^2}{2m_C^2} \hat{\mathbf{p}}' \right),\\
% 	p_b' &= \left( \frac{m_C^2-m_B^2}{2m_C^2}, -\frac{m_C^2-m_B^2}{2m_C^2} \hat{\mathbf{p}}' \right). \nonumber
% \end{align}
To evaluate $m_X^2$, we must evaluate $p_b$ and $p_A$ in the same reference frame. We choose to transform $p_b'$ to $p_b$ in the rest frame of $B$. This is easiest by using the invariance of the Minkowski norm, which gives
\begin{align}
	(p_b + p_B)^2 &= (p_b' + p_B')^2 = m_C^2\nonumber \\
				  &= m_B^2 + 2m_B|\mathbf{p}_b|\\
	\Rightarrow |\mathbf{p}_b| &= \frac{m_C^2 - m_B^2}{2m_B},\nonumber
\end{align}
where we have used that $\mathbf p_B = \mathbf{0}$ in the rest frame of $B$. Now, we may assume without loss of generality that the decay products of $C\to Bb$ are aligned along the $x$-axis. The decay $B\to Aa$ will make an angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:lorentz_boost}. 
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/appendix/lorentz_boost.pdf}
\caption{Lorentz boost from rest frame of $C$ to rest frame of $B$.}
\label{fig:lorentz_boost}
\end{figure}
The spherical distribution of the decay direction of $A$ is isotropic in the rest frame of $B$ if $B$ is a scalar, which means that $\cos\theta$ is uniformly distributed. We then get
\begin{align}
	m_X^2 &= (p_A + p_b)^2 = m_A^2 + 2E_A|\mathbf{p}_b| - 2|\mathbf{p}_A||\mathbf{p}_b|\cos\theta\\
		&= m_A^2 + 2\left( m_A^2 + \frac{(m_B^2 - m_A^2)^2}{4m_B^2} \right)^{1/2}\frac{m_C^2 - m_B^2}{2m_B} -2\frac{m_B^2-m_A^2}{2m_B}\frac{m_C^2 - m_B^2}{2m_B}\cos\theta\nonumber \\
		&= m_A^2 + \frac{m_C^2 - m_B^2}{2m_B^2}\left( m_B^2(1-\cos\theta) + m_A^2(1+\cos\theta) \right).\nonumber
\end{align}
The limiting cases are
\begin{align}
	\cos\theta = -1 &\Rightarrow {m_X^2}_\mathrm{high} = m_A^2 + m_C^2 - m_B^2,\\
	\cos\theta = +1 &\Rightarrow {m_X^2}_\mathrm{low} = \frac{m_C^2 m_A^2}{m_B^2}.\nonumber
\end{align}
We see that $m_X^2$ is monotonically decreasing as a function of $\cos\theta$ between these limits, which means $m_X$ is as well. We note that the interval $(m_{X\mathrm{low}},m_{X\mathrm{high}})$ is always a subset of the interval $(m_A, m_C)$ for any physical combination of $m_{A,B,C}$, so $m_X$ is always consistent with chain kinematics. For the example of SPS1a discussed in the text, $m_A$, $m_B$ and $m_C$ are 97 GeV, 144 GeV and $180~\mathrm{GeV}$, respectively. The limits then evaluate to ${m_X}_\mathrm{high} = 145 ~\mathrm{GeV}$ and ${m_X}_\mathrm{low} = 121 ~\mathrm{GeV}$. The probability distribution for $m_X$ in this case --- assuming that $B$ is a scalar, as indeed it is if it is a slepton --- is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mX-dist}.

\chapter{A C++ implementation of the Nelder-Mead {\tt Simplex} algorithm}
\label{ch:simplex}
Adapted from \cite{simplex-implementation}. The function to call for minimization is {\tt amoeba}. It returns true or false depending on whether convergence has been obtained within the set number of iterations. The {\tt xisquared} function uses the {\tt Armadillo} linear algebra library \cite{Armadillo}.
